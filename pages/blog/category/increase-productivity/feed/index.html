<p>The iT360 team is excited to bring you our first ever quarterly newsletter. Milan Kruger, iT360’s very own Account Manager was instrumental in helping us conceptualise this name. Read his story on why ‘bytesize’.  </p>



<p>When the Marketing team had the task of launching a newsletter, they didn’t approach an agency or decide in a closed boardroom with the Executive Team what the name should be. Instead,&nbsp;the leadership team took the decision that this should be outsourced to our very own staff&nbsp;and to give them an opportunity to be a part of the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An internal competition was launched to all staff across email and Teams, inviting them to participate with a prize up for grabs. The response rate was incredible with our brand ambassadors emailing the Marketing team their comments or suggestions within the first two days alone. With over 45 suggestions, the decision to narrow it down to the final choice was incredibly difficult, however the name ‘bytesize’ resonated with the Leadership team and fit the objective of the quarterly newsletter. Bite size pieces of information that extend beyond just technology, but provides our clients with insights, trends, thought leadership pieces and recommendations by industry leaders. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="599" height="149" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/it360-newsletter-bytesize.png" alt="it360 newsletter bytesize" class="wp-image-8219" title="What&#039;s in a Name? How We Chose a Name for Our Newsletter 1"></figure>



<p>We asked Milan what inspired him&nbsp;in&nbsp;recommending&nbsp;the&nbsp;name and this is what he had to say:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We live in such an ever-evolving technological world. We must be given true and accurate information as changes happen, when they happen. I thought, what better way to do that than a byte size of information (excuse the pun). This way you can stay up to date with everything technology, New Zealand and globally related without having to sift through hours of complex technical jargon. Rather have everything you and your company need in a quick, easy to access newsletter in bytesize chunks</p><cite>—Milan Kruger, Account Manager, iT360</cite></blockquote>

<p>Implementing change is one of the most difficult things business leaders face in their organizations. Oftentimes, the main reason change efforts fail is there is not enough buy-in from end-users themselves.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because they were left out in the decision-making process. In this article, we&#8217;ll show you how you can introduce new technology (or systems, or processes, or tools) in order to minimize failure and increase changes of adaption.</p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/bxc0p2kf1c.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_bxc0p2kf1c popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span> <br><br>



<h2>3 Ways to Increase Success of Implementing MS Teams</h2>



<p>At this point, you already know the benefits of using <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">MS Teams</a> and how you can use it to make yourself and everyone in your business more productive.</p>



<p>But, your staff might not know that, nor believe in it. Below are 4 things you should consider when you want to implement some changes in your organisation.</p>



<h3>1. Solve the Right Problems</h3>



<p>The first thing you need to do is make sure that the solution you are proposing (in this case MS Teams) will really help your team solve their problems. This means taking the time to <strong>sit down with key people</strong> to learn about what’s happening in their day-to-day activities.</p>



<p>Your people are busy, just like you.</p>



<p>Simply adding more tools for them to use makes it difficult because of the learning curve and the organization inertia you need to overcome. If they are not invested in it, no one will use it.</p>



<p>Getting clear on what problems you plan on solving and why people need to change is one of the first things you should deal with. </p>



<p>For example, are people having problems about too much emails? Or are they emailing files to each other and end up with lots of versions of the same one? </p>



<p>Or perhaps you want a new way to work with your customers by having a single portal for communication? </p>



<p>Knowing which problems you plan on tackling is important if you want to succeed in introducing new technology to your business. </p>



<p>And did I mention, Teams can help you with all those problems. </p>



<h3>2. Find a Champion</h3>



<p>In order to increase the chances for success of implementing Teams, you need to find a champion. This is someone who can help identify the most pressing needs and train other people if needed.</p>



<p>This champion doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be the business owner or a VP or head of IT. They just have to be someone who&#8217;ll be directly responsible for the implementation and making sure everyone uses it. </p>



<h3>3. Just Get Started</h3>



<p>The final tip is to just get started. Most people start off by using it for chat. It can be as simple as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-ms-teams-for-internal-communication-5-different-options/">sending a message to a colleague</a>. It will grow from there. </p>



<p>Once you get the hang of chats, you can move to talking about building your first <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/teams-and-channels/">channel</a>. </p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>



<p>These are just simple guidelines to help you implement MS Teams in your organisation.</p>



<p>The main challenge for every change initiative is there is little buy-in from the end-users. Even if there is nothing to fear about, people respond negatively from change.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to solve for the right problems. You don&#8217;t implement new technology just for the sake of using it. Having a champion in your organisation also helps reduce this risk of failure. </p>



<p>If you and your team start using Microsoft Teams on a daily basis, people will find confidence in the tool. They get to experience first-hand what it&#8217;s like to be more productive. </p>

<p>Organisations of all sizes are scrambling to find ways to enable their staff to work from home. With the country on Alert Level 4 now, only essential businesses are allowed to stay open. </p>



<p>Just take a look at this Google Trends report that shows the interests in the topic over time for the term &#8220;working from home&#8221; here in New Zealand.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="365" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/work-from-home-trends-1024x365.png" alt="Google Trends report for the term working from home in New Zealand for the past 12 months" class="wp-image-7952" title="Is Your Organisation Ready for Remote Work? Here Are 7 Questions You Need to Answer 2"></figure>



<p>Other phrases like remote work or telecommuting also show the same trend. And it looks the same for other countries as well. The only difference is that some countries are hitting that spike a week or two earlier than here in New Zealand. That&#8217;s most likely because they have been hit with the coronavirus first. </p>



<p>So, is your business ready for remote work? Here are 7 questions you need to answer. </p>



<ol><li><a href="#communication">Do you have a unified tool for communication? </a></li><li><a href="#collaboration">Do you have a collaboration software? </a></li><li><a href="#documents">Where do your staff store files and documents? </a></li><li><a href="#access">Can you access these tools/apps/software from outside your office? </a></li><li><a href="#training">Do your staff have the proper training for each of these tools? </a></li><li><a href="#equipment">Do your staff have the proper equipment so they can work from home?</a></li><li><a href="#security">Do you have security measures in place for your staff&#8217;s devices? </a></li></ol>



<p>If you are having trouble answering them, or you know the answers don&#8217;t look good, you might need someone to help guide you through this situation. <link href="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.css" rel="stylesheet">

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="958" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work-setup-testimonial-grand-davidson-ceo-qes-1024x958.png" alt="Grant Davidon, CEO of QES, shares his feedback about implementing remote work for his team" class="wp-image-7953" title="Is Your Organisation Ready for Remote Work? Here Are 7 Questions You Need to Answer 3"></figure>



<h2>7 Questions You Need to Answer to Find Out if You&#8217;re Ready to Work From Home</h2>



<h3 id="communication">1. Do you have a unified tool for communication?</h3>



<p>As you probably already realized, communication is essential especially during these times. Having a single place of internal communication is critical if you want to move fast. </p>



<p>Sure, you might have SMS, phone calls, Skype, Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other tools out there. But if communication is fragmented, it&#8217;s difficult for people to find the information they need when they need it. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s why using tools like <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> makes it easier for everyone since it supports different options (audio, video, chat) in one place. </p>



<h3 id="collaboration">2. Do you have a collaboration software?</h3>



<p>In the workplace, you can walk up to somebody or even invite them to a conference room if you wanted to meet. But if everyone is working remotely, it&#8217;s logistically impossible. </p>



<p>Unless you have a collaboration tool in place. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s unrealistic to have to chat someone or video call them every single time you need to say something. You (and more importantly, they) won&#8217;t get anything done. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s why project management tools like Asana and Trello are popular because you can work on projects and tasks with other people within the system. You can communicate everything about the project, like providing feedback or adding tasks, inside the system. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://luna1.co/995ed7.png" alt="Sample asana project with tasks where people can collaborate" title="Is Your Organisation Ready for Remote Work? Here Are 7 Questions You Need to Answer 4"></figure>



<h3 id="documents">3. Where do your staff store files and important documents? </h3>



<p>Do you use a file server in your organisation, or does everyone store the files on their local computer? </p>



<p>What about hard copies? Are they in the office in a central location? Or are they on the desks of each of your staff? </p>



<p>Answering these questions is important because if you don&#8217;t have <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">a single place to store your files</a>, you can end up with tons of duplicates. This results in inefficiencies that can lead to not just wasting time finding the most updated version, but can also contribute to hardware issues. </p>



<p>This becomes more prominent when you suddenly have to implement telecommuting in the business. </p>



<h3 id="access">4. Can you access these tools and files from outside the office? </h3>



<p>The first three questions are simple and easy to answer. Most organisations have some form of communication or collaboration tools setup. But because these are in the form of legacy software, it&#8217;s designed only to run within the company network. </p>



<p>And with remote work, that is certainly not possible. </p>



<p>If you want your team to work from home during this pandemic, they have to be able to do the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>communicate with each other efficiently</strong> —that means using a unified tool for communication</li><li><strong>collaborate with each other effectively</strong>—that means using a project management tool to handle storing projects and other work</li><li><strong>access important files and documents</strong>—that means everyone has the proper access to important documents with the latest versions</li></ul>

<p>If you are not sure or the answers to these questions don&#8217;t look good, <a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/it360-solutions/covid19-readiness'});return false;">we can help you through this situation</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>To have 100 staff working remotely and the whole organisation still connected within about three days is a big effort.</p><cite>Glenn Manson, CFO, Odyssey</cite></blockquote>



<h3 id="training">5. Do your staff have the proper training for each of these tools?</h3>



<p>Using an app is one thing. Receiving the proper training to do <em>your</em> work using that tool is another. </p>



<p>Without proper training and education, you and your team might be underutilizing the software. </p>



<p>For example, if you are using Microsoft Teams, you might only think of it as a chat and video conferencing tool. But it goes way beyond that. Watch this short video on how you can integrate other apps to MS Teams. </p>

<h3 id="equipment">6. Do your staff have the proper equipment so they can work from home?</h3>



<p>This question often gets overlooked. </p>



<p>Not everyone has the proper equipment to handle the work they do at their homes. Not everyone has computers as well. </p>



<p>But this doesn&#8217;t stop at computers and laptops. </p>



<ul><li>Do they have internet? Does it have enough speed and bandwidth to handle the new work?</li><li>What about speakers, video camera, and other peripherals (graphics drawing tablet and stylus, </li></ul>



<p>Of course, all of these would depend on the nature of your business. </p>



<p>Finding the answers to these questions will help you understand what else you need to do in order to implement remote work effectively. </p>



<p>For example, you find out your half your staff doesn&#8217;t have the proper equipment at home— whether they are underspec&#8217;d or don&#8217;t have devices—but your office has them. What do you do? </p>



<ul><li>Are they allowed to take home the devices?</li><li>Can it run on their home network? </li><li>Do you have a policy for taking devices out from the office? </li></ul>



<h3 id="security">7. Do you have security measures in place for people working from home?</h3>



<p>Some might overlook this aspect, but most business networks have some sort of firewall and security measures in place. Each device might have anti-malware software installed and other special configurations that reduce security risks. </p>



<p>But personal devices might not have them. How can you&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>navigate through this situation? </li><li>&#8220;force&#8221; everyone to install an antivirus solution? </li><li>protect your company&#8217;s sensitive data while allowing your staff to continue their work uninterrupted?</li></ul>



<p>Of course, there are other security measures you can do to protect your business&#8217; data like requiring multi-factor authentication to access your accounts. </p>



<p>But then again, those only work if you are already using cloud-based tools like <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/office-365/">Office 365</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncsc.govt.nz/newsroom/covid-19-useful-cybersecurity-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre </a>(NCSC) is encouraging organisations to maintain a high level of cyber security resilience and awareness during the national response to COVID-19.

<p>Organisations of all sizes are scrambling to find ways to enable their staff to work from home. With the country on Alert Level 4 now, only essential businesses are allowed to stay open. </p>



<p>Just take a look at this Google Trends report that shows the interests in the topic over time for the term &#8220;working from home&#8221; here in New Zealand.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="365" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/work-from-home-trends-1024x365.png" alt="Google Trends report for the term working from home in New Zealand for the past 12 months" class="wp-image-7952" title="Is Your Organisation Ready for Remote Work? Here Are 7 Questions You Need to Answer 5"></figure>



<p>Other phrases like remote work or telecommuting also show the same trend. And it looks the same for other countries as well. The only difference is that some countries are hitting that spike a week or two earlier than here in New Zealand. That&#8217;s most likely because they have been hit with the coronavirus first. </p>



<p>So, is your business ready for remote work? Here are 7 questions you need to answer. </p>



<ol><li><a href="#communication">Do you have a unified tool for communication? </a></li><li><a href="#collaboration">Do you have a collaboration software? </a></li><li><a href="#documents">Where do your staff store files and documents? </a></li><li><a href="#access">Can you access these tools/apps/software from outside your office? </a></li><li><a href="#training">Do your staff have the proper training for each of these tools? </a></li><li><a href="#equipment">Do your staff have the proper equipment so they can work from home?</a></li><li><a href="#security">Do you have security measures in place for your staff&#8217;s devices? </a></li></ol>



<p>If you are having trouble answering them, or you know the answers don&#8217;t look good, you might need someone to help guide you through this situation. <link href="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.css" rel="stylesheet">

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="958" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work-setup-testimonial-grand-davidson-ceo-qes-1024x958.png" alt="Grant Davidon, CEO of QES, shares his feedback about implementing remote work for his team" class="wp-image-7953" title="Is Your Organisation Ready for Remote Work? Here Are 7 Questions You Need to Answer 6"></figure>



<h2>7 Questions You Need to Answer to Find Out if You&#8217;re Ready to Work From Home</h2>



<h3 id="communication">1. Do you have a unified tool for communication?</h3>



<p>As you probably already realized, communication is essential especially during these times. Having a single place of internal communication is critical if you want to move fast. </p>



<p>Sure, you might have SMS, phone calls, Skype, Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other tools out there. But if communication is fragmented, it&#8217;s difficult for people to find the information they need when they need it. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s why using tools like <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> makes it easier for everyone since it supports different options (audio, video, chat) in one place. </p>



<h3 id="collaboration">2. Do you have a collaboration software?</h3>



<p>In the workplace, you can walk up to somebody or even invite them to a conference room if you wanted to meet. But if everyone is working remotely, it&#8217;s logistically impossible. </p>



<p>Unless you have a collaboration tool in place. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s unrealistic to have to chat someone or video call them every single time you need to say something. You (and more importantly, they) won&#8217;t get anything done. </p>



<p>That&#8217;s why project management tools like Asana and Trello are popular because you can work on projects and tasks with other people within the system. You can communicate everything about the project, like providing feedback or adding tasks, inside the system. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://luna1.co/995ed7.png" alt="Sample asana project with tasks where people can collaborate" title="Is Your Organisation Ready for Remote Work? Here Are 7 Questions You Need to Answer 7"></figure>



<h3 id="documents">3. Where do your staff store files and important documents? </h3>



<p>Do you use a file server in your organisation, or does everyone store the files on their local computer? </p>



<p>What about hard copies? Are they in the office in a central location? Or are they on the desks of each of your staff? </p>



<p>Answering these questions is important because if you don&#8217;t have <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">a single place to store your files</a>, you can end up with tons of duplicates. This results in inefficiencies that can lead to not just wasting time finding the most updated version, but can also contribute to hardware issues. </p>



<p>This becomes more prominent when you suddenly have to implement telecommuting in the business. </p>



<h3 id="access">4. Can you access these tools and files from outside the office? </h3>



<p>The first three questions are simple and easy to answer. Most organisations have some form of communication or collaboration tools setup. But because these are in the form of legacy software, it&#8217;s designed only to run within the company network. </p>



<p>And with remote work, that is certainly not possible. </p>



<p>If you want your team to work from home during this pandemic, they have to be able to do the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>communicate with each other efficiently</strong> —that means using a unified tool for communication</li><li><strong>collaborate with each other effectively</strong>—that means using a project management tool to handle storing projects and other work</li><li><strong>access important files and documents</strong>—that means everyone has the proper access to important documents with the latest versions</li></ul>

<p>If you are not sure or the answers to these questions don&#8217;t look good, <a href="" onclick="Calendly.initPopupWidget({url: 'https://calendly.com/it360-solutions/covid19-readiness'});return false;">we can help you through this situation</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>To have 100 staff working remotely and the whole organisation still connected within about three days is a big effort.</p><cite>Glenn Manson, CFO, Odyssey</cite></blockquote>



<h3 id="training">5. Do your staff have the proper training for each of these tools?</h3>



<p>Using an app is one thing. Receiving the proper training to do <em>your</em> work using that tool is another. </p>



<p>Without proper training and education, you and your team might be underutilizing the software. </p>



<p>For example, if you are using Microsoft Teams, you might only think of it as a chat and video conferencing tool. But it goes way beyond that. Watch this short video on how you can integrate other apps to MS Teams. </p>

<h3 id="equipment">6. Do your staff have the proper equipment so they can work from home?</h3>



<p>This question often gets overlooked. </p>



<p>Not everyone has the proper equipment to handle the work they do at their homes. Not everyone has computers as well. </p>



<p>But this doesn&#8217;t stop at computers and laptops. </p>



<ul><li>Do they have internet? Does it have enough speed and bandwidth to handle the new work?</li><li>What about speakers, video camera, and other peripherals (graphics drawing tablet and stylus, </li></ul>



<p>Of course, all of these would depend on the nature of your business. </p>



<p>Finding the answers to these questions will help you understand what else you need to do in order to implement remote work effectively. </p>



<p>For example, you find out your half your staff doesn&#8217;t have the proper equipment at home— whether they are underspec&#8217;d or don&#8217;t have devices—but your office has them. What do you do? </p>



<ul><li>Are they allowed to take home the devices?</li><li>Can it run on their home network? </li><li>Do you have a policy for taking devices out from the office? </li></ul>



<h3 id="security">7. Do you have security measures in place for people working from home?</h3>



<p>Some might overlook this aspect, but most business networks have some sort of firewall and security measures in place. Each device might have anti-malware software installed and other special configurations that reduce security risks. </p>



<p>But personal devices might not have them. How can you&#8230;</p>



<ul><li>navigate through this situation? </li><li>&#8220;force&#8221; everyone to install an antivirus solution? </li><li>protect your company&#8217;s sensitive data while allowing your staff to continue their work uninterrupted?</li></ul>



<p>Of course, there are other security measures you can do to protect your business&#8217; data like requiring multi-factor authentication to access your accounts. </p>



<p>But then again, those only work if you are already using cloud-based tools like <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/office-365/">Office 365</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today’s world, we often have a plethora of available tools available for us to communicate with our friends, family, and colleagues in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this is very convenient, this availability of single-use tools or apps makes it very confusing and time-consuming whenever we need to find that conversation again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is very crucial, especially in the workplace. Imagine the inefficiency when you send an email back to your boss, customer, or colleague saying that you can’t find the data for the report they sent you last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll share the different ways you can communicate inside MS Teams and how you can use them to tailor your communication and be more effective.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>5 Ways to Communicate Inside Microsoft Teams</h2>



<p>Have you ever thought about communication in general?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about the last time you sent a thank you card to someone you interviewed with in the mail, or a phone call to your spouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communication, at its simplest definition, is made up of someone sending a message using a medium to someone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our analogy above, you’d see the different aspects in play:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Thank You Card<ul><li>You — the sender</li><li>Card — includes both the message and the medium</li><li>Interviewer — recipient&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Phone Call<ul><li>You — sender (and recipient)&nbsp;</li><li>Phone — medium</li><li>Conversation — message</li><li>Spouse — recipient (and sender)&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>At work, and life in general, we communicate with other people in a variety of ways. But, we often don’t think about the recipient and the best way to send our message across.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communicating effectively means using a different medium depending on the person (or people) you’re talking to and the type of message you’re trying to convey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a short question or an update might do well in a written form, while a discussion on a topic or project will do better in a call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Microsoft Teams, you can use different types of medium to communicate more effectively and avoid misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Chat: 1-on-1 or group chats</h3>



<p>The most-used feature of Teams is chats. You can chat 1-on-1, or participate in group or team chats. It really depends on the topic or conversation.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you are working on a project with your team, or simply want to chat about relevant updates in the industry. There are 15 of you in the team. All topics and discussions about the project goes here. Everyone who is part of the channel gets to see and can participate in the chat.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="612" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch7_team_conversation-1024x612.png" alt="1 on 1 Chats inside MS Teams" class="wp-image-7206" title="Using MS Teams for Internal Communication: 5 Different Options 8"></figure>



<p>But if you’re requesting for a leave from your boss, that conversation might be better using a private or 1:1 chat.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Voice notes</h3>



<p>Sometimes, you’re on-the-go, or you’re doing something with your hands. Or simply want to send a quick update or message and don’t have time (or being lazy about it) to type on the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams offers the ability to leave voice notes/messages.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="750" height="1288" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch7_voice_memos.gif" alt="How to leave voice notes in MS Teams" class="wp-image-7208" title="Using MS Teams for Internal Communication: 5 Different Options 9"></figure>



<p>Just like chats, this can be sent to a person (private chat) or to a group.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Calls</h3>



<p>You already know that written messages can often be misinterpreted (and is often a big cause for misunderstandings). The main reason for this is written communication often lack an important part of communication like tone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for conversations that require back-and-forth discussion, it’s best to get on a call. It’s easier, faster, and helps avoid miscommunication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you can do this with your phone, why not take advantage of “free” calls inside Teams directly?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best part is you can also call people outside your organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. Video calls</h3>



<p>One of the best ways to meet with other people is face-to-face. No one can doubt that. Body language, or non-verbal communication, makes up over 50% of the communication and is lost on calls and chats and email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But because of the changing demands of work, it becomes necessary that we adapt as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s how video conferencing comes in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can meet with people who are across the globe, or at another location, or in the airport, as if we were meeting with them face-to-face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll learn more about this in the next chapter.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>5. Video recordings</h3>



<p>This last type of media available in MS Teams is often used for people who can’t attend a meeting with their colleagues. It’s a great way to catch up on what happened as if you were there too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you have a weekly recurring meeting with your team that discusses strategies, projects, and updates. For some reason, you have to be on a plane that exact time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone is busy and can’t reschedule.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="912" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch7_video_recording-1024x912.png" alt="video recordings in MS Teams" class="wp-image-7207" title="Using MS Teams for Internal Communication: 5 Different Options 10"></figure>



<p>If anyone from the team records the call, the recording will be available for everyone to see in just a few minutes. So, even if you were on a plane, you can catch up with the entire call after you land. This includes all discussions and even the presentations itself.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>MS Teams allows you to communicate with your team in various forms/ or media that allow you to send your message more effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can use private chats and messages, conduct phone calls, and video calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next chapter, you’ll learn more about how to use MS Teams to conduct instant meetings.</p>
