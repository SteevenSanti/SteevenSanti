<p>The gender discussion continues to be an intriguing one when it comes to the Tech sector. <a href="https://idealog.co.nz/tech/2019/06/steps-forward-still-some-way-go-women-nz-tech-weigh-key-takeaways-myobs-women-tech-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even after New Zealand became the first country worldwide more than 125 years ago in which women attained the right to vote, the sector is still highly skewed</a> towards males. </p>



<p>In this article, we interview two women in technology about their experiences and thoughts about the industry. </p>



<h2>Interview with Hilary Walton</h2>



<p>In this article, iT360 spoke to Hilary Walton, Chief Information Security Officer of the Kordia Group on her thoughts around this and advice she has for businesses and women.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Hilary-Walton.jpg" alt="Hilary Walton, CISO Kordia Group " class="wp-image-8232" width="332" height="498" title="Women in Tech 1"></figure>



<p>Hilary Walton&nbsp;is&nbsp;responsible for the business-critical connectivity, cyber security and cloud solutions for clients in both Australia and New Zealand within the Kordia Group.&nbsp;That is how&nbsp;her&nbsp;business profile describes her. </p>



<p>After chatting to Hilary though we got to see that she is much more than this. She is not your typical chief information security officer. Hilary is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;Security Culture expert, a Psychologist,&nbsp;an author,&nbsp;an IT and business transformation leader&nbsp;and&nbsp;a mother of 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She also&nbsp;wants to make the world a better place by inspiring more diversity in the Tech sector.&nbsp;When recounting what&nbsp;AUT lecturer and She# founder Dr Mahsa&nbsp;Mohaghegh&nbsp;said that&nbsp;<a href="https://idealog.co.nz/tech/2019/06/steps-forward-still-some-way-go-women-nz-tech-weigh-key-takeaways-myobs-women-tech-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“The stats about women in leadership are also concerning, with only 25 percent of local tech business having equal representation in this space. This is another situation that really needs to change to help improve the stats across the board,”</a> we&nbsp;knew we had to speak to Hilary about her viewpoints&nbsp;on this subject.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>How do you feel the role of women in tech has evolved over the last decade?</em></strong></p>



<p>Slowly, too slowly. I think back to my experience of growing up. The first job I wanted to do was to be an astronaut, then it was a vet, and then, I hit society and the only job I could see in business for a woman was to be a secretary. Now there is nothing wrong with being a secretary of course, but it does illustrate that a young girl full of dreams and&nbsp;aspirations,&nbsp;is affected by what they see reflected in&nbsp;society. At university, I did&nbsp;actually work&nbsp;part time as a receptionist, and I think that’s when I realised that all the&nbsp;studying,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;doing,&nbsp;was so that I could do something else, and the dreamer kicked back in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it&nbsp;is important to acknowledge that I have had a privileged upbringing.  While I have grown up in a patriarchal society no doubt, as a white middle-class woman I was lucky to have had great schooling and extracurricular opportunities, a great group of supportive friends as well as all the basics like food on the table and parents who loved me without boundaries and who believed I could be, and should be, anything I wanted to be – the “you go girl” mentality was firmly embedded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as women in tech are concerned, the number of focused efforts to get more girls and women into tech&nbsp;are&nbsp;certainly helping and need to continue. My experience of speaking to students at universities and&nbsp;polytechs&nbsp;about tech and security is, that over half of the classes are women. So,&nbsp;we are certainly attracting more and more to the industry, which is fantastic. The thing I worry about is that we are not keeping them in tech.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Women are self-opting out usually when they hit the $70-$100k roles, which tends to coincide with the thought of how they are going to manage being mothers AND being women in tech. Being in tech&nbsp;they&nbsp;are&nbsp;maybe more likely to have a male manager,&nbsp;and they are looking around at how other women going on maternity leave are treated and the career pathways, or not, before them. They are leaning back from their careers when they should be&nbsp;leaning in&nbsp;(as Cheryl Sandberg would say) to jobs that are rewarding, enjoyable and are worth being away from&nbsp;baby&nbsp;for. They think&nbsp;‘my salary is only just covering our childcare, it’s not worth it, I should just stay home’, but that sets them up for opting out of higher paid tech roles in the future and reduces their future earning potential. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;short term thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you feel women are being given enough of a platform in this space?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I see many good platforms to celebrate women in tech now,&nbsp;example the&nbsp;Reseller News Women in ICT Awards being one of those, which is extremely positive. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a hot subject and one with much interest and attention because of its importance to&nbsp;fuelling&nbsp;the tech sector with skilled people and because it&nbsp;is the right thing to do.&nbsp;However, there is still lots of work to do in&nbsp;workplaces, and generally at the management, senior management and Executive level, as so&nbsp;many&nbsp;trickles down from the top. For example, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;common that a male will get praise for their technical&nbsp;skill&nbsp;and a&nbsp;woman&nbsp;will get praise for their organisational skills – even though both are in technical roles. We need to&nbsp;remember,&nbsp;that&nbsp;the patriarchy&nbsp;is a system, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not a bunch of bad people. It&nbsp;is a system that has run for hundreds&nbsp;of years and that it takes time&nbsp;change&nbsp;mindsets. It&nbsp;is also a system that has meant that males too have often had to conform to the stereotype of being aggressive,&nbsp;un-emotional&nbsp;and dominating. And there are lots of males out there that that does&nbsp;not&nbsp;suit, as much as it has&nbsp;not&nbsp;suited all women to be outsiders, be likeable and be dominated.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Are we introducing our young girls into this field as much as we should and what can be done better?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>When we think about changing mindsets, it means we need to check ourselves&nbsp;and also&nbsp;others,&nbsp;and keep the discussion going. It is so embedded that I even catch myself conforming to societal norms with women being pigeonholed one way and men being pigeonholed another.  For example,&nbsp;I have two boys and a girl. And truth be told, there are times I have guided my little girl to maternal things like dolls and prams, instead of science things like planets and stars.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not easy to make sure you provide all the right experiences for children, or people in the workplace, so that they see technology as&nbsp;viable&nbsp;options. The point is I&nbsp;am&nbsp;trying,&nbsp;and we need to keep up the effort and ‘check’ ourselves and each other more often.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another keen crucial thing to be done is a fairer representation of women in senior management and executive technology roles. It’s hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;what we don’t see.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>And a one-liner word of wisdom&nbsp;you can&nbsp;give to women in this field and in general?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>You belong. Don’t pretend to be it, just decide and be it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Interview with Saba Samiei</h2>



<p>Saba&#8217;s mission in life is to do her best in creating a better future for humanity and all that lives around us. She has quite&nbsp;a diverse&nbsp;experience in the tech industry from hands-on coding to leading multi-million-dollar&nbsp;transformation projects. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saba-682x1024.jpg" alt="Saba Samiei " class="wp-image-8233" width="341" height="512" title="Women in Tech 2"></figure>



<p>Saba developed an in-depth passion for artificial intelligence back in 2017 and has dedicated her life outside of work to this topic ever since.&nbsp;In 2017, Saba was recognised as the top 3 finalists in New Zealand CIO emerging leader awards and top 4 finalists in Women of Influence Young leader awards. </p>



<p>In 2019 she has been recognised as New Zealand Reseller News 30 under 30 and has recently won the Rising Star awards at Reseller News NZ Women in ICT awards. Saba has recently founded her own company called Comfort.AI with the intention&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;artificial intelligence the comfort zone of her audience. </p>



<p>She is also contracting at Microsoft as a partner development manager, helping New Zealand businesses grow using Microsoft technology. Saba&#8217;s motto in life is &#8220;I&#8217;ll find a way or make one!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>How do you feel the role of women in tech has evolved over the last&nbsp;decade?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I cannot&nbsp;speak of the last decade or compare it with the time prior to that as I have only been in the workforce for 8 years. What I do know is that while a lot of progress has been made there is still a lot more work to be done not just to embrace gender diversity but all types of diversity example&nbsp;talent, culture, sexual orientation, disability etc. I also know that women bring a compassionate side to the business which is fundamental to embracing diversity and creating an inclusive work culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>You won an amazing award recently. Tell us more about this and what it meant to you and for women of your&nbsp;generation?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Ha-ha! Yes, I am very humbled by this recognition. The award that I won was Reseller News NZ, Women in ICT award, rising star category. This category and award&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;women with less than 8 years of experience who demonstrate a commitment to continuous career advancement with a proven desire to reach the next level of professional development. I came to New Zealand as a&nbsp;22-year-old,&nbsp;from a completely different world with no family or friends here. I had no idea of the country I was coming to and what the future was going to be like. I only had one very clear goal in mind and that was to be a good citizen of this new world and&nbsp;everyday&nbsp;be a better version of myself. This meant that I was and still am competing with myself every day, and as someone who has her head down and works continuously,&nbsp;I sometimes lose sight of what I have achieved. This award meant&nbsp;too&nbsp;much to me because it was a good reminder of my achievements over the last 8 years. I also think for anyone who gets nominated, makes&nbsp;it as&nbsp;a finalist or wins this award&nbsp;it shows them the same level of appreciation. I am thankful to RSNZ for sponsoring this&nbsp;every year!  &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Do you feel women are being enough of a platform in this space?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I think the industry as it stands today is built on some legacy mindsets and anyone with a different voice than that of the existing ones disrupts the status quo and therefore can and will be treated differently. This happens to you regardless of your&nbsp;gender&nbsp;however, because most of this legacy mindset was built on a more male centric view, women see and feel these differences the most. From what I see, we have come a long&nbsp;way,&nbsp;but we also have a long way to go. The day we no longer need ‘women in XX’ initiatives or the day that you no longer see news headlines like “First women in a particular job” is the day that we can say women are being enough of a platform.&nbsp;Same&nbsp;goes for all other traits of diversity.   &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>You are regarded as a thought leader when it comes to AI. Do you feel the industry is introducing enough young women into this specific field quickly enough or even doing enough to encourage women to participate in it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>No,&nbsp;I don’t. I think we do&nbsp;not&nbsp;have enough people being encouraged to learn about AI in general and specifically women in this field are incredibly rare to find. I think this has some to do with the fact that the education system always plays catch up when it comes to new technologies as opposed to being a leading industry and encouraging young people to learn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And&nbsp;also,&nbsp;some to do with the fact that there is this perception of AI that is a complicated tech and therefore requires a lot of STEM knowledge to get your head around it. We already see&nbsp;lack&nbsp;of women in STEM so, naturally we see a lack of women in AI too. I also think with AI growing at the pace that it is growing&nbsp;now and other upcoming technologies it is of utmost importance that we start educating people of all ages and all levels about AI and what the future could look like. Most importantly we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;help the next generation be change&nbsp;resilient. Women&nbsp;in particular need&nbsp;to participate in shaping the future of AI, we have seen time and time again how biased AI can be and this is not the fault of the&nbsp;technology,&nbsp;but it roots in the fact that our data as humans is quite biased and we need to&nbsp;change&nbsp;that. We need to change that fast!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>You started your own AI company. Can you tell us what inspired you to go this route and what fears you encountered along the&nbsp;way?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Yes, my company is called Comfort.AI and my motto is “Making artificial intelligence your comfort zone.” I have been an AI Ethics researcher for four years and&nbsp;still&nbsp;going. One of the biggest dangers that I have identified via my research is lack of awareness about AI. AI is an industry with billions of investment dollars globally and according to The World Economic Forum it will increase our global economy by 16 trillion dollars (you can buy 8 companies the size of Apple with that money!), this means the impact that AI will have on our lives is significant. Comfort.AI is dedicated to educating people in the industry as well as&nbsp;the society&nbsp;and&nbsp;the schools&nbsp;about artificial intelligence. This includes workshops for C-Suit, middle management and end user in the companies as well as research services and consulting services to help companies navigate through this world of AI as opposed to investing in projects that they are not clear about the outcome of. Also, a percentage of the company’s revenue is dedicated to educating the society about AI via free workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>Any one-liner advice you can give to other women starting off in this field or in general&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>I always live by a personal motto in my life and I advise that to anyone who believes in it too – Don’t take no for an answer, find a way or make one!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>iT360 has been through a transformative change&nbsp;the&nbsp;past 12 – 18 months and even more so at an Executive level. </p>



<p>In this article we chat&nbsp;to three senior leaders&nbsp;within the business on their respective insights and thoughts of the year and for the business.: </p>



<ol><li><a href="#steve">Steve Sherwood</a> — Head of Sales and Customer Experience </li><li><a href="#jess">Jess Mason</a> — Head of Marketing and Brand Experience</li><li><a href="#callum">Callum Galloway</a> — Head of Operations&nbsp;and Corporate Services</li></ol>



<h2 id="steve">Steve Sherwood on Making a Positive Impact</h2>



<p>I think we are under no&nbsp;false illusion&nbsp;that 2020 has been&nbsp;very unique&nbsp;and ultimately presented itself as a&nbsp;year of fight or flight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leadership, culture, pivoting (almost the buzzword of 2020) to offer enhanced value for our clients in a new environment – everything changed before our eyes…&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SteveS1-683x1024.jpg" alt="Steve Sherwood" class="wp-image-8206" width="342" height="512" title="The Leader&#039;s Forum: Thoughts and Insights for 2020 and Beyond 3"><figcaption><em>Steve Sherwood, Head of Sales &amp; Customer Experience</em>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>We chose to fight, not only for ourselves but for our customers and focused&nbsp;on delivering solutions that helped&nbsp;shape what we perceived&nbsp;as&nbsp;the “New Way of Working”&nbsp;and to enhance customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, our bets paid off. We&nbsp;are seeing many more clients operating on a hybrid work platform (Home/Office) with the primary place of work being from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly enough,&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel there is more traffic on the road than ever!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work from home environment presents itself challenges; security, accessibility to quality broadband, quality time with family versus spending more hours working, client meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an established IT company of near on 26 years, we have weathered many local and global economic obstacles, however, I feel that COVID-19 has presented New Zealand with an opportunity of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/remote-work/">advancing remote working</a> 4+ years. </p>



<p>It has tested us through level 4 and 3 lockdowns, it has forced the incumbent network operator to ensure broadband within New Zealand is robust and has dovetailed this into many consumers and businesses <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/questions-to-answer-remote-work/">questioning the fabric of their security offering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2020 has&nbsp;taught me that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-ms-teams-for-internal-communication-5-different-options/">communication</a> and enablement go hand in hand. On one side of the spectrum,&nbsp;clear, concise communication goes a&nbsp;long way,&nbsp;and trust of your employees by way of enabling them to make tough calls and to run with solutions&nbsp;(with myself being the “support office”),&nbsp;has been one of the most freeing experiences I have gone through as a leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good framework of architecture through to robust processes as a business and being there as a support mechanism for the team has really showcased what our team can truly deliver,&nbsp;and when I mean truly deliver,&nbsp;I&nbsp;am referring&nbsp;to creating and executing solutions that not only make a positive impact in efficiency for our customers&nbsp;and&nbsp;taking that next step to helping our customers’&nbsp;customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moral has always been at the heart of&nbsp;iT360,&nbsp;as we are an organisation that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">walks the talk around people first</a>.&nbsp;It has required me to modify my&nbsp;leadership approach, step back to become more of an enabler and support system to the team, and this approach has paid off in dividends and&nbsp;indicative&nbsp;in our customer satisfaction results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For me personally and as I&nbsp;draw to a close&nbsp;on 2020, my question to other senior leaders&nbsp;is &#8220;What&nbsp;are you and your organisation implanting, changing,&nbsp;or&nbsp;creating to make way for a new way of working; not only for your customers but for your employees as well?”&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Jess Mason on Learning and Unlearning</h2>



<p>I joined iT360 on the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;August 2020, and two weeks later we&nbsp;were faced with a second lockdown.&nbsp;I am no stranger to working in adverse circumstances or making the best of a bad situation&nbsp;and having been through the first lockdown with a previous company I felt adequately prepared for it.&nbsp;After all, I had just come off a&nbsp;successful brand&nbsp;relaunch in the&nbsp;first&nbsp;lockdown&nbsp;and I had a mindset of “this too shall pass”.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="400" height="400" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jess.jpg" alt="Jess Mason" class="wp-image-8238" title="The Leader&#039;s Forum: Thoughts and Insights for 2020 and Beyond 4"><figcaption><em>Jess&nbsp;Mason, Head of Marketing &amp; Brand Experience</em>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However,&nbsp;if the pandemic has taught me one thing,&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;one should not ever assume&nbsp;that&nbsp;you are 100% prepared&nbsp;nor should you ever feel comfortable that there is a&nbsp;state of equilibrium.&nbsp;As a strategic&nbsp;and growth&nbsp;marketer, the pandemic felt like a new market&nbsp;opportunity was being created across all industries or sectors.&nbsp;Its&nbsp;evoked feelings of ‘blue ocean’ thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For me as a mom, wife and career woman it&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;a new normal&nbsp;but introduced a new way of working as a family and business unit.&nbsp;I watched as some families struggled through, whilst others seemed to have everything pretty much under control&nbsp;and my realisation was that everyone had to create their own level of normality or sanity.&nbsp;My home became a series of schedules stuck on a wall which was more a guide rather than&nbsp;a rulebook. </p>



<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;I married well&nbsp;(laughs),&nbsp;and my partner is a fully engaged father&nbsp;so while I was in a Team’s meeting, he was spending time with our son Milo.&nbsp;We made the decision that our&nbsp;first priority&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;our family unit&nbsp;and how we balanced that, so we tried to create as much consistency and stability for our little one, and for our marriage. That was our non-negotiable. </p>



<p>Everything else then seemed to fall in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, we had those moments of outbursts or woe is me&nbsp;from all three of us, but I’ve found that if the core is grounded&nbsp;well,&nbsp;the rest pretty much comes back to balance at some point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a business level,&nbsp;I did&nbsp;feel that initially there was a sense of naivety within&nbsp;most companies;&nbsp;that&nbsp;operationally things&nbsp;would remain the same, that staff would need to deliver against the same objectives, and there was an initial lack of understanding and empathy amongst senior leaders.&nbsp;What businesses and probably most managers had not anticipated was this sudden&nbsp;overnight impact&nbsp;of&nbsp;workload&nbsp;on family life. </p>



<p>CEO’s and MD’s fundamentally became stay at home dads&nbsp;and where prior to COVID you could&nbsp;‘escape’&nbsp;to your office for some peace and quiet,&nbsp;your entire home was now your home office, schedules and meetings worked around your home life, and we all became teachers overnight. Talk about a rude awakening!&nbsp;</p>



<p>A key insight for me&nbsp;which I continue to live by&nbsp;and which I took out of COVID however&nbsp;is the theory of&nbsp;‘learning to unlearn’, which&nbsp;everyone has had to embrace in some form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s the theory that before you can move forward, implement anything new&nbsp;or enhance yourself, you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;empty your cup and embrace new thinking.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">unlearn those practices</a> that might have worked a year ago&nbsp;and learn a new practice, or system that is more conducive to the current landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And&nbsp;it’s not about sugar-coating&nbsp;or&nbsp;back engineering&nbsp;your current systems to make them&nbsp;work but&nbsp;being brave enough to realise that your entire operating model probably needs an overhaul if you want to remain relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a marketer and with my background being in brand marketing,&nbsp;I have always had a natural appreciation for brand connecting with the consumer and&nbsp;companies&nbsp;having a purpose first.&nbsp;Somehow over the years many companies have lost sight of that especially within the Tech industry. The last year has&nbsp;flipped this on its head. </p>



<p>Brand has become the primary focus once again, as opposed to products and solutions. Companies have had to&nbsp;rethink how and where they engage with their customers,&nbsp;so&nbsp;deep&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;the customer journey&nbsp;has become more important than ever. It’s almost&nbsp;liked&nbsp;the world has returned to Marketing&nbsp;and Customer&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer&nbsp;relationships which&nbsp;should always be at the forefront of the business strategy&nbsp;has&nbsp;resurfaced across&nbsp;B2C and B2B&nbsp;as if it’s a new mantra.&nbsp;Now more than ever customers want to know they can trust and believe in their service providers or the companies they interact with.&nbsp;Agile&nbsp;working which&nbsp;has always felt like a buzz word&nbsp;is now a key strategic imperative across the business from Operations to Brand and how companies show up to their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving forward businesses will&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;focus on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/automation-is-changing-everything/">automation</a> and ecommerce as key imperatives. Remote working&nbsp;is a way of life&nbsp;and we see this happening&nbsp;already&nbsp;with big companies such as Twitter, Unilever and Facebook.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Collaboration tools</a> such as Teams and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/teams-calling/">Teams calling</a>&nbsp;will become a bigger part of a company’s arsenal. And companies will need to invest more&nbsp;into&nbsp;the right technology, hardware, or devices&nbsp;to improve staff and operational&nbsp;efficiencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure/">Investment in technology</a> is not a luxury but a necessity.&nbsp;Marketers are still going to feel the&nbsp;brunt of this with budgets being severely compromised, which is a shame because cutting the marketing budget is strategically the&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;move. It’s a reactive&nbsp;move based on fear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital and&nbsp;content rich strategies&nbsp;should have been a strategic pillar regardless of COVID,&nbsp;but how are marketers&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to&nbsp;upskill themselves to fill&nbsp;those gaps&nbsp;previously held by agencies or outside suppliers&nbsp;is going to be an imperative for SME’s and larger organisations alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall,&nbsp;I always remain optimistic&nbsp;that this too shall pass.&nbsp;It’s like any perfect storm;&nbsp;batten down the hatches and keep pushing&nbsp;through and&nbsp;continue to unlearn what we’ve learnt to make way for improvement!&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Callum Galloway on Adapting to Change</h2>



<p><strong><em>Can you tell us how your role as a Senior iT360 leader has had to change over the last year?</em></strong></p>



<p>What leadership has not changed this year right? One minute you are looking at having a better year than 2019, the next minute, you find yourself putting together DR plans for your clients because they are coming to you for assistance with managing their business which has now been thrust into the pits of a pandemic. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CallumG-682x1024.jpg" alt="Callum Galloway" class="wp-image-4774" width="341" height="512" title="The Leader&#039;s Forum: Thoughts and Insights for 2020 and Beyond 5"><figcaption>Callum Galloway, Head of Operations &amp; Corporate Services</figcaption></figure>



<p>Leadership to me&nbsp;has always been about supporting those in your team. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing like a pandemic to get you in&nbsp;the supportive headspace and quickly. </p>



<p>We were after a good 2020 and firmly believed we had built strong foundations in 2019 to set us up for just that into 2020, however with how things turned out, your focus simply has to change from not just strong business objectives but to including strong people objectives.</p>



<ul><li>‘How well are my team going, really?’ </li><li>‘How can we support our staff who have kids being home-schooled now?’ </li><li>‘How can we intentionally create a&nbsp;sense of community with this enormous void of human physical interaction?’ </li></ul>



<p>It has&nbsp;certainly been hard,&nbsp;and I think I&nbsp;have&nbsp;failed more times than I succeeded. But that has&nbsp;simply been my experience of 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&nbsp;has&nbsp;been about GRIT! </p>



<p>To keep&nbsp;on going to get through the tough times but doing what you can, when you can, however you can,&nbsp;to ensure the team&nbsp;are&nbsp;ok. They may not be thriving with the challenges of 2020 but doing everything you can,&nbsp;in order for&nbsp;them to not dip below being&nbsp;ok&nbsp;should be a priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So yes, it has&nbsp;been a hard year for business leaders. They&nbsp;are&nbsp;not immune to the stresses and weight of&nbsp;the challenges.&nbsp;In summary, my role has moved heavily into&nbsp;support&nbsp;of anyone that needs it in the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>How has&nbsp;iT360&nbsp;evolved, changed or transformed over the last year within your area specifically?</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My role has&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;expanded to encompass more areas and responsibilities. Establishing new parameters within the&nbsp;projects&nbsp;team to keep the team focused has been a huge priority&nbsp;to deliver&nbsp;a better&nbsp;project experience for our customers. </p>



<p>The establishment of a new <a href="https://it360.co.nz/our-people/">Client Onboarding department</a> has been necessary due to the volume of new clients coming into the iT360 family this year.</p>



<p>Overseeing the Service Desk Department with our new Service Desk Coordinator Josh Tait has meant a significant change in our business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is never easy replacing people that have a strong history and experience within the role and that does take time, however, I feel that the department will be in a better way going forward to deliver better experiences going forward.  </p>



<p><strong><em>How did you and your team tackle COVID whilst ensuring that service delivery did not fall through the gaps?&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a challenge for every business. First things first, we huddled around a whiteboard to try and gather as much information and input as we could. </p>



<p>We put strong <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/our-covid-19-learnings/">plans in place</a> to ensure we could continue supporting our clients as they would be going through the same thing as we would. We pep-talked our team to brace themselves. We kept the lines of communication open with our clients and assured them that we were going to be here for them; that the hours were not going to be a problem, we would just make sure our clients were ready and able to work where they were able to, mostly from home. </p>



<p>We kept a spreadsheet on the status of our clients and their remote working situation. This required getting constant feedback of what clients needed via the respective account managers. And then we simply rolled up our sleeves to get things going. </p>



<p>The first lockdown for iT360 was extremely stressful as I am sure it was for everyone across New Zealand. We were privileged to be able to continue supporting our clients as an Essential Services business, as many businesses lost that opportunity due to the enforced restrictions.</p>



<p><strong><em>Let’s talk about how you remodelled service delivery in iT360. How does your current team differ to what you had a year ago and why was this shift important?</em></strong></p>



<p>It has certainly been hard to focus on the business this year. So much has been about survival and getting through the next wave of challenges. We had to grow our Service Team from four engineers to eight within the Service Desk due to the demands from our clients as well as the growth we have come to see. </p>



<p>Onboarding has taken a huge focus thus creating a specialised role for Chris Jordan who previously headed up the Service Desk area. </p>



<p>Thankfully for us, Chris has a passion for customer service and is a very talented engineer as well. Overall, I feel fortunate that we have such great members in our team.</p>



<p><strong><em>What words of advice can you offer&nbsp;other&nbsp;senior leaders as we move into the new year?</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am a parent of two young kids; I have a wonderful wife and our business has grown from 14-24 in a pandemic. Change is ramping up still in terms of what our customers want and how we deliver. I am sure it is the same in every industry. I think in amongst all the work and challenges, senior leaders need to focus more and more on rest. </p>



<p>Whether that is literally prioritising sleep to be our best selves or simply re-prioritising what is important as opposed to just moving onto the next big thing. There will never be enough time in the day, but we certainly can increase the value of the time we have by bringing a rested, healthy version of one’s self to that time we have been given. </p>



<p><strong><em>What books do you have on your bedside stand or are&nbsp;reading&nbsp;right now that you can highly recommend?&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to Talk to Kids so they will listen.  </p>



<p>Perfect Management / People Leadership reading.  </p>



<p><strong><em>What are your plans for this Festive season</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking the new bike out to the mountains, many beach trips, planning for 2021 and trying to figure out how to deliver on all the requests my&nbsp;three-year-old&nbsp;puts&nbsp;forward to Santa when he met with him this past weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The iT360 team is excited to bring you our first ever quarterly newsletter. Milan Kruger, iT360’s very own Account Manager was instrumental in helping us conceptualise this name. Read his story on why ‘bytesize’.  </p>



<p>When the Marketing team had the task of launching a newsletter, they didn’t approach an agency or decide in a closed boardroom with the Executive Team what the name should be. Instead,&nbsp;the leadership team took the decision that this should be outsourced to our very own staff&nbsp;and to give them an opportunity to be a part of the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An internal competition was launched to all staff across email and Teams, inviting them to participate with a prize up for grabs. The response rate was incredible with our brand ambassadors emailing the Marketing team their comments or suggestions within the first two days alone. With over 45 suggestions, the decision to narrow it down to the final choice was incredibly difficult, however the name ‘bytesize’ resonated with the Leadership team and fit the objective of the quarterly newsletter. Bite size pieces of information that extend beyond just technology, but provides our clients with insights, trends, thought leadership pieces and recommendations by industry leaders. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="599" height="149" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/it360-newsletter-bytesize.png" alt="it360 newsletter bytesize" class="wp-image-8219" title="What&#039;s in a Name? How We Chose a Name for Our Newsletter 6"></figure>



<p>We asked Milan what inspired him&nbsp;in&nbsp;recommending&nbsp;the&nbsp;name and this is what he had to say:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We live in such an ever-evolving technological world. We must be given true and accurate information as changes happen, when they happen. I thought, what better way to do that than a byte size of information (excuse the pun). This way you can stay up to date with everything technology, New Zealand and globally related without having to sift through hours of complex technical jargon. Rather have everything you and your company need in a quick, easy to access newsletter in bytesize chunks</p><cite>—Milan Kruger, Account Manager, iT360</cite></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It has been a big year. A year for the books!</p>



<p>My team and I are super excited to bring you the first edition of our iT360 Quarterly newsletter aptly called “Bytesize”. We hope you find this an interesting and exciting read and more so the story on how we came up with the name.</p>



<p>As the team at iT360 close off the last calendar quarter and start winding down to spend quality time with our family and friends over this festive season, we reflect on our business and how we have operated amongst great challenges. We think back on how we have helped a couple thousand New Zealanders work from home remotely, in an incredibly short period of time, how we have helped and supported businesses with their technology and IT solutions, and to quickly adapt through what has been some of the toughest times we have all had to face as business owners, employees, and parents.</p>



<p>As a soon-to-be dad during the pandemic, it also introduced a new dilemma and interesting challenge into my own personal life. The balancing act of running a business, and a sense of commitment to my team, and customers, and that of being a husband and father. Having a solid leadership team behind me has made that transition easier. Trusting in that leadership team even more so. I quickly realised that if we were to maintain this trajectory, we had to invest in resources and the right people with the skillsets needed to move the business forward. This required a dramatic shift in mindset especially as a small business owner, having highly qualified individuals heading up strategic areas such as Operations, Service, Sales and Marketing. I realised we needed to think bolder, smarter and be braver in our decisions, now more than ever if we wished to remain relevant for our customers.</p>



<p>As a small business we have increased our headcount by six people since the first lockdown earlier this year, and it has been awesome and gratifying to know that we were in a position to provide jobs to those that have lost them because of the pandemic. We remained steadfast in our commitment to our team that salaries would remain intact, positions unaffected and it was important to the leadership team to continually reinforce this sense of reassurance during those uncertain months. And there was a lot of uncertainty, not just within our own company, but within the country and the rest of the world as well.</p>



<p>As CEO I remain committed to continually listening to our customers, adapting, growing and partnering better with you to deliver business and technology solutions, so that you can continue to drive success in your own business and also ultimately best serve your end consumer.</p>



<p>However, I am also always mindful that in any business that is growing in numbers, there is a chance for cracks to emerge, customer service to slip and things to change quickly. So, as we move forward into 2021, we do so with two primary goals; which are to lead with a ‘one team’ culture and to keep customer service and experience at the centre of everything that we do. This remains our core and is underpinned by having a capable team that is highly skilled in delivering great service, is aligned around a common vision, and shows up every day to serve our customers and deliver awesome customer experiences.</p>



<p>On behalf of iT360 I would like to extend my gratitude for your continued support, partnership and belief in us as your technology solutions provider over the past year. From my iT360 family to yours, I wish you, your team and your loved ones a safe and happy festive season and a healthy, prosperous 2021. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>Have a merry Christmas</p>

<p>Wondering how other organisations use <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>? Here are four interviews from different industry experts sharing how they use MS Teams and how it&#8217;s transforming the way they do business. </p>



<p>In this article, you&#8217;ll find 4 videos that cover specific topics. You can either watch the video, or read the write-up, or both. Enjoy! </p>



<h2>Get to Know the People in the Videos</h2>



<ul><li>Anthony McMahon, Chief Technologist, the <a href="https://vcto.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT Psychiatrist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janine-brittain-3ab119b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janine Brittain</a>, Microsoft Modern Workplace BDM, <a href="https://online.exeed.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exeed</a></li><li>Randy Chapman, Head of Consulting, <a href="https://www.enablit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enablit</a> and Microsoft AVP</li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-kelley-msft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Kelley</a>, Teams Customer Success Black Belt, Microsoft</li></ul>



<h2>Part 1: Focus on Solving Problems</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/1uychuo5z2.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_1uychuo5z2 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>One of the best ways to implement Microsoft Teams is to focus on a specific problem that it solves. You don&#8217;t need to dive into each individual feature. </p>



<p>Just answer the question &#8220;How is MS Teams going to help my business with ______?&#8221; Focus on problem instead. </p>



<ul><li><strong>You want to host a video call with several clients</strong>. Here&#8217;s how you do it. </li><li><strong>What about accessibility</strong>? Can I use it on any device? What if I switch from my work desktop computer to my mobile phone, to my home laptop? Yup, MS Teams got you covered. </li><li><strong>What about an unstable internet connection</strong>? MS Teams doesn&#8217;t need a perfect internet connection to run. </li></ul>



<h2>Part 2: Collaboration Made Easy</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/i56okw1amc.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_i56okw1amc popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>Microsoft calls Teams the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/work-better-implementing-hub-for-teamwork/">hub for teamwork</a>. If you aren&#8217;t using it for collaboration, you&#8217;re not using it right. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re tired of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/teams-vs-email-which-communication-medium-can-adapt-to-your-business-needs/">too many emails</a> and constant <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">storage and file issues</a>, then you will benefit greatly from using MS Teams. </p>



<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-buttons aligncenter">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-light-gray-color has-background has-vivid-red-background-color" style="border-radius:3px" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Access the Teams in 10 Days Videos</a></div>
</div>



<h2>Part 3: More Than Just Chat</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ipmkfxiqp8.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ipmkfxiqp8 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>How are you using MS Teams? Do you use it for chat and video calls? Good. That&#8217;s the most basic functionality. </p>



<p>Did you know you can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-ms-teams-for-internal-communication-5-different-options/">leave audio or voice notes</a> too? This is especially helpful if you&#8217;re on-the-go and want to send a message to someone quickly. </p>



<p>Have you tried recording your meeting? This is a great option for both internal and external uses. Internally, someone might not be able to make it to the meeting because of an emergency. With a single click of a button, you can record the entire meeting and it will be available to everyone in the channel. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a great way to record conversations with clients or other third party vendors. If you combine it with the whiteboard feature, or even just a regular meeting, this will be a very nice value-add. </p>



<p>What about trying to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-teams-integration-with-other-apps/">work on the same files together</a>? You know, those monthly reports you send out. Or that spreadsheet everyone needs to add their inputs to. Instead of sending out the files from one person to another, causing multiple file versions, you can work on the files together inside Microsoft Teams. </p>



<h2>Part 4: Rolling Out MS Teams</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/wm3ik5n445.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_wm3ik5n445 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>What&#8217;s the easiest way to roll out Microsoft Teams in your organisation? Show, don&#8217;t tell. </p>



<p>Demonstrate how easy it is to use different use cases. For example, one of the concerns of many during a virtual call is of privacy. MS Teams has a built-in function that, with a click of a button, blurs your entire background. This is perfect for work-from-home situations where you don&#8217;t want other meeting attendees to see what&#8217;s behind you. </p>



<p>One of the upsides of in-person meetings is the ability to illustrate what you&#8217;re trying to explain—whether that&#8217;s a diagram, a flowchart, or simply mapping out a concept. With MS Teams, there&#8217;s a feature called <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-whiteboard-in-microsoft-teams-7a6e7218-e9dc-4ccc-89aa-b1a0bb9c31ee?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whiteboard</a> where you can do that. Now, there&#8217;s a lower barrier to conducting meetings since you do not have to always prepare slides.  </p>



<p>If you need help implementing MS Teams in your organisation, fill-out the form below and someone from our team will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>One of the best features of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> is the ability to collaborate with your colleagues right from the app itself. </p>



<p>That’s right, there’s no need to send emails back-and-forth and run the risk of having 5 “final” versions of the same document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every organisation is different. The way you work is unique to you. But, there are certain apps/tools we use that might be similar. </p>

<h2>3 Ways You Can Collaborate with Your Colleagues Using MS Teams</h2>



<p>We briefly mentioned this in another post and showed you an example of what it looks like with Asana connected. </p>



<p>Here, I’ll be sharing several examples but the process all starts the same. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="569" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch9_add_tab-1024x569.gif" alt="ch9 add tab" class="wp-image-7213" title="Microsoft Teams Integration with Other Apps 7"></figure>



<p>First, you head on over to the channel you want to add the app/file in. Click on the plus (+) icon to add another tab. You’ll be presented with several apps there. </p>



<p>If you can’t find the app you&#8217;re looking for, you can try searching for it here. </p>



<p>Select the app you want. You then set it up by giving MS Teams access to it (kind of like when you use an email client like Outlook and you want to access your Gmail accounts). </p>



<p>It’s from here where the process/steps deviate.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Project management — Asana</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="960" height="540" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch9_how_to_add_asana.gif" alt="ch9 how to add asana" class="wp-image-7219" title="Microsoft Teams Integration with Other Apps 8"></figure>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to add Asana an Asana Project to MS Teams.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Setup your project in Asana. Once you have your project setup, remember its name.&nbsp;</li><li>Go into the appropriate channel inside MS Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the plus (+) to add a new app&nbsp;</li><li>Select Asana</li><li>If this is your first time setting this up, you’ll be asked to login. If you already did this before, proceed to the next step.&nbsp;</li><li>Choose the correct organisation, if you are part of any.&nbsp;</li><li>Search for the project you want to import.&nbsp;</li><li>Click ‘save’</li><li>The Asana project you added will now be available as one of the tabs at the top of that channel.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Once you’ve done this, you can see the new tab added on that specific channel. You and your team can now manage this particular project without leaving MS Teams.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Tracking via spreadsheet — Excel</h3>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to add an Excel file your team can collaborate together inside MS Teams. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1080" height="600" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch9_how_to_add_excel.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-7220" title="Microsoft Teams Integration with Other Apps 9"></figure>



<ol><li>Go into the appropriate channel inside MS Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the plus (+) to add a new app&nbsp;</li><li>Select Excel</li><li>Rename the tab</li><li>Locate the file you want to add. This may take a couple of clicks as you navigate around the folders.&nbsp;</li><li>Click ‘save’</li><li>The Excel file you added will now be available as one of the tabs at the top of that channel.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3>3. Working on a report — PowerPoint</h3>



<p>This process is very similar to the previous one (Excel). </p>



<p>Ever wondered how to eliminate the constant emailing back-and-forth of reports? You send one version, then Sally adds their revision, then sends it back not knowing John was also working on a few edits. </p>



<p>Now, you have three different file versions—an updated one from Sally and another from John. So, which one do you use? </p>



<p>The best way to reduce this confusion, save everyone time, and save a lot of emails and disk space, add it on to MS Teams and edit their in real-time together. </p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>Microsoft Teams calls itself as the hub for teamwork. And that’s true. In today’s world, companies no longer have the luxury to be inefficient and unproductive. Every tool that helps them overcome these challenges is definitely worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online meetings, virtual meetings, Zoom calls, virtual conferences—these have become the norm in our lives. When it comes to the professional setting, time matters a lot. That&#8217;s why making sure that your internet connection, audio and/or video settings are working properly sends a sign of professionalism. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>, here&#8217;s how you do it. </p>



<div margin:"auto"><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/h8eym6u7ce.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_h8eym6u7ce popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:601px">&nbsp;</span></div>



<p>A lot of people think that hopping on a call or any meeting (whether that&#8217;s in-person or online) is enough. What people don&#8217;t realize is that real professionals spend a few minutes preparing for the meeting. </p>



<p>Reviewing the agenda, taking a look at the previous notes and action items, and, in virtual meetings, testing their technology. </p>



<p>Testing your setup before any call is a great practice. </p>



<p>This is even more important if you constantly switch from multiple devices and equipment. For example, you use a laptop, desktop, and your phone to conduct calls. Then you also have your wireless and wired earphones. All-in-all, those are very different configurations. </p>



<p>Imagine this scenario. You have a scheduled call at 9:30 AM. You joined on the call on your phone and stepped away from your desk. You might think your wireless headphones will connect automatically to your phone, but since you used them last on your desktop, that&#8217;s where it connected. And now, 15 seconds into the call and audio is still coming from your desktop computer. You scramble to fix the connection. And now, right after fixing it, you explain what happened. A few minutes in and you still haven&#8217;t started talking about your agenda. </p>



<p>Take the time to test your internet and audio levels before every meeting. It&#8217;ll save you and the people you&#8217;re meeting with a lot of time. </p>
