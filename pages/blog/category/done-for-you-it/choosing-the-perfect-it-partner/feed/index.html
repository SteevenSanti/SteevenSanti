<p>iT360 has been through a transformative change&nbsp;the&nbsp;past 12 – 18 months and even more so at an Executive level. </p>



<p>In this article we chat&nbsp;to three senior leaders&nbsp;within the business on their respective insights and thoughts of the year and for the business.: </p>



<ol><li><a href="#steve">Steve Sherwood</a> — Head of Sales and Customer Experience </li><li><a href="#jess">Jess Mason</a> — Head of Marketing and Brand Experience</li><li><a href="#callum">Callum Galloway</a> — Head of Operations&nbsp;and Corporate Services</li></ol>



<h2 id="steve">Steve Sherwood on Making a Positive Impact</h2>



<p>I think we are under no&nbsp;false illusion&nbsp;that 2020 has been&nbsp;very unique&nbsp;and ultimately presented itself as a&nbsp;year of fight or flight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leadership, culture, pivoting (almost the buzzword of 2020) to offer enhanced value for our clients in a new environment – everything changed before our eyes…&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SteveS1-683x1024.jpg" alt="Steve Sherwood" class="wp-image-8206" width="342" height="512" title="The Leader&#039;s Forum: Thoughts and Insights for 2020 and Beyond 1"><figcaption><em>Steve Sherwood, Head of Sales &amp; Customer Experience</em>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>We chose to fight, not only for ourselves but for our customers and focused&nbsp;on delivering solutions that helped&nbsp;shape what we perceived&nbsp;as&nbsp;the “New Way of Working”&nbsp;and to enhance customer experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, our bets paid off. We&nbsp;are seeing many more clients operating on a hybrid work platform (Home/Office) with the primary place of work being from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly enough,&nbsp;I&nbsp;feel there is more traffic on the road than ever!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work from home environment presents itself challenges; security, accessibility to quality broadband, quality time with family versus spending more hours working, client meetings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an established IT company of near on 26 years, we have weathered many local and global economic obstacles, however, I feel that COVID-19 has presented New Zealand with an opportunity of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/remote-work/">advancing remote working</a> 4+ years. </p>



<p>It has tested us through level 4 and 3 lockdowns, it has forced the incumbent network operator to ensure broadband within New Zealand is robust and has dovetailed this into many consumers and businesses <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/questions-to-answer-remote-work/">questioning the fabric of their security offering</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2020 has&nbsp;taught me that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-ms-teams-for-internal-communication-5-different-options/">communication</a> and enablement go hand in hand. On one side of the spectrum,&nbsp;clear, concise communication goes a&nbsp;long way,&nbsp;and trust of your employees by way of enabling them to make tough calls and to run with solutions&nbsp;(with myself being the “support office”),&nbsp;has been one of the most freeing experiences I have gone through as a leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good framework of architecture through to robust processes as a business and being there as a support mechanism for the team has really showcased what our team can truly deliver,&nbsp;and when I mean truly deliver,&nbsp;I&nbsp;am referring&nbsp;to creating and executing solutions that not only make a positive impact in efficiency for our customers&nbsp;and&nbsp;taking that next step to helping our customers’&nbsp;customer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moral has always been at the heart of&nbsp;iT360,&nbsp;as we are an organisation that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">walks the talk around people first</a>.&nbsp;It has required me to modify my&nbsp;leadership approach, step back to become more of an enabler and support system to the team, and this approach has paid off in dividends and&nbsp;indicative&nbsp;in our customer satisfaction results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For me personally and as I&nbsp;draw to a close&nbsp;on 2020, my question to other senior leaders&nbsp;is &#8220;What&nbsp;are you and your organisation implanting, changing,&nbsp;or&nbsp;creating to make way for a new way of working; not only for your customers but for your employees as well?”&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Jess Mason on Learning and Unlearning</h2>



<p>I joined iT360 on the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;August 2020, and two weeks later we&nbsp;were faced with a second lockdown.&nbsp;I am no stranger to working in adverse circumstances or making the best of a bad situation&nbsp;and having been through the first lockdown with a previous company I felt adequately prepared for it.&nbsp;After all, I had just come off a&nbsp;successful brand&nbsp;relaunch in the&nbsp;first&nbsp;lockdown&nbsp;and I had a mindset of “this too shall pass”.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img width="400" height="400" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Jess.jpg" alt="Jess Mason" class="wp-image-8238" title="The Leader&#039;s Forum: Thoughts and Insights for 2020 and Beyond 2"><figcaption><em>Jess&nbsp;Mason, Head of Marketing &amp; Brand Experience</em>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>However,&nbsp;if the pandemic has taught me one thing,&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;one should not ever assume&nbsp;that&nbsp;you are 100% prepared&nbsp;nor should you ever feel comfortable that there is a&nbsp;state of equilibrium.&nbsp;As a strategic&nbsp;and growth&nbsp;marketer, the pandemic felt like a new market&nbsp;opportunity was being created across all industries or sectors.&nbsp;Its&nbsp;evoked feelings of ‘blue ocean’ thinking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For me as a mom, wife and career woman it&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;a new normal&nbsp;but introduced a new way of working as a family and business unit.&nbsp;I watched as some families struggled through, whilst others seemed to have everything pretty much under control&nbsp;and my realisation was that everyone had to create their own level of normality or sanity.&nbsp;My home became a series of schedules stuck on a wall which was more a guide rather than&nbsp;a rulebook. </p>



<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;I married well&nbsp;(laughs),&nbsp;and my partner is a fully engaged father&nbsp;so while I was in a Team’s meeting, he was spending time with our son Milo.&nbsp;We made the decision that our&nbsp;first priority&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;our family unit&nbsp;and how we balanced that, so we tried to create as much consistency and stability for our little one, and for our marriage. That was our non-negotiable. </p>



<p>Everything else then seemed to fall in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, we had those moments of outbursts or woe is me&nbsp;from all three of us, but I’ve found that if the core is grounded&nbsp;well,&nbsp;the rest pretty much comes back to balance at some point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a business level,&nbsp;I did&nbsp;feel that initially there was a sense of naivety within&nbsp;most companies;&nbsp;that&nbsp;operationally things&nbsp;would remain the same, that staff would need to deliver against the same objectives, and there was an initial lack of understanding and empathy amongst senior leaders.&nbsp;What businesses and probably most managers had not anticipated was this sudden&nbsp;overnight impact&nbsp;of&nbsp;workload&nbsp;on family life. </p>



<p>CEO’s and MD’s fundamentally became stay at home dads&nbsp;and where prior to COVID you could&nbsp;‘escape’&nbsp;to your office for some peace and quiet,&nbsp;your entire home was now your home office, schedules and meetings worked around your home life, and we all became teachers overnight. Talk about a rude awakening!&nbsp;</p>



<p>A key insight for me&nbsp;which I continue to live by&nbsp;and which I took out of COVID however&nbsp;is the theory of&nbsp;‘learning to unlearn’, which&nbsp;everyone has had to embrace in some form.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s the theory that before you can move forward, implement anything new&nbsp;or enhance yourself, you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;empty your cup and embrace new thinking.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">unlearn those practices</a> that might have worked a year ago&nbsp;and learn a new practice, or system that is more conducive to the current landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And&nbsp;it’s not about sugar-coating&nbsp;or&nbsp;back engineering&nbsp;your current systems to make them&nbsp;work but&nbsp;being brave enough to realise that your entire operating model probably needs an overhaul if you want to remain relevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a marketer and with my background being in brand marketing,&nbsp;I have always had a natural appreciation for brand connecting with the consumer and&nbsp;companies&nbsp;having a purpose first.&nbsp;Somehow over the years many companies have lost sight of that especially within the Tech industry. The last year has&nbsp;flipped this on its head. </p>



<p>Brand has become the primary focus once again, as opposed to products and solutions. Companies have had to&nbsp;rethink how and where they engage with their customers,&nbsp;so&nbsp;deep&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;the customer journey&nbsp;has become more important than ever. It’s almost&nbsp;liked&nbsp;the world has returned to Marketing&nbsp;and Customer&nbsp;101.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer&nbsp;relationships which&nbsp;should always be at the forefront of the business strategy&nbsp;has&nbsp;resurfaced across&nbsp;B2C and B2B&nbsp;as if it’s a new mantra.&nbsp;Now more than ever customers want to know they can trust and believe in their service providers or the companies they interact with.&nbsp;Agile&nbsp;working which&nbsp;has always felt like a buzz word&nbsp;is now a key strategic imperative across the business from Operations to Brand and how companies show up to their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moving forward businesses will&nbsp;continue to&nbsp;focus on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/automation-is-changing-everything/">automation</a> and ecommerce as key imperatives. Remote working&nbsp;is a way of life&nbsp;and we see this happening&nbsp;already&nbsp;with big companies such as Twitter, Unilever and Facebook.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Collaboration tools</a> such as Teams and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/teams-calling/">Teams calling</a>&nbsp;will become a bigger part of a company’s arsenal. And companies will need to invest more&nbsp;into&nbsp;the right technology, hardware, or devices&nbsp;to improve staff and operational&nbsp;efficiencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure/">Investment in technology</a> is not a luxury but a necessity.&nbsp;Marketers are still going to feel the&nbsp;brunt of this with budgets being severely compromised, which is a shame because cutting the marketing budget is strategically the&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;move. It’s a reactive&nbsp;move based on fear.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital and&nbsp;content rich strategies&nbsp;should have been a strategic pillar regardless of COVID,&nbsp;but how are marketers&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to&nbsp;upskill themselves to fill&nbsp;those gaps&nbsp;previously held by agencies or outside suppliers&nbsp;is going to be an imperative for SME’s and larger organisations alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall,&nbsp;I always remain optimistic&nbsp;that this too shall pass.&nbsp;It’s like any perfect storm;&nbsp;batten down the hatches and keep pushing&nbsp;through and&nbsp;continue to unlearn what we’ve learnt to make way for improvement!&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Callum Galloway on Adapting to Change</h2>



<p><strong><em>Can you tell us how your role as a Senior iT360 leader has had to change over the last year?</em></strong></p>



<p>What leadership has not changed this year right? One minute you are looking at having a better year than 2019, the next minute, you find yourself putting together DR plans for your clients because they are coming to you for assistance with managing their business which has now been thrust into the pits of a pandemic. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CallumG-682x1024.jpg" alt="Callum Galloway" class="wp-image-4774" width="341" height="512" title="The Leader&#039;s Forum: Thoughts and Insights for 2020 and Beyond 3"><figcaption>Callum Galloway, Head of Operations &amp; Corporate Services</figcaption></figure>



<p>Leadership to me&nbsp;has always been about supporting those in your team. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing like a pandemic to get you in&nbsp;the supportive headspace and quickly. </p>



<p>We were after a good 2020 and firmly believed we had built strong foundations in 2019 to set us up for just that into 2020, however with how things turned out, your focus simply has to change from not just strong business objectives but to including strong people objectives.</p>



<ul><li>‘How well are my team going, really?’ </li><li>‘How can we support our staff who have kids being home-schooled now?’ </li><li>‘How can we intentionally create a&nbsp;sense of community with this enormous void of human physical interaction?’ </li></ul>



<p>It has&nbsp;certainly been hard,&nbsp;and I think I&nbsp;have&nbsp;failed more times than I succeeded. But that has&nbsp;simply been my experience of 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&nbsp;has&nbsp;been about GRIT! </p>



<p>To keep&nbsp;on going to get through the tough times but doing what you can, when you can, however you can,&nbsp;to ensure the team&nbsp;are&nbsp;ok. They may not be thriving with the challenges of 2020 but doing everything you can,&nbsp;in order for&nbsp;them to not dip below being&nbsp;ok&nbsp;should be a priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So yes, it has&nbsp;been a hard year for business leaders. They&nbsp;are&nbsp;not immune to the stresses and weight of&nbsp;the challenges.&nbsp;In summary, my role has moved heavily into&nbsp;support&nbsp;of anyone that needs it in the business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>How has&nbsp;iT360&nbsp;evolved, changed or transformed over the last year within your area specifically?</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>My role has&nbsp;certainly&nbsp;expanded to encompass more areas and responsibilities. Establishing new parameters within the&nbsp;projects&nbsp;team to keep the team focused has been a huge priority&nbsp;to deliver&nbsp;a better&nbsp;project experience for our customers. </p>



<p>The establishment of a new <a href="https://it360.co.nz/our-people/">Client Onboarding department</a> has been necessary due to the volume of new clients coming into the iT360 family this year.</p>



<p>Overseeing the Service Desk Department with our new Service Desk Coordinator Josh Tait has meant a significant change in our business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is never easy replacing people that have a strong history and experience within the role and that does take time, however, I feel that the department will be in a better way going forward to deliver better experiences going forward.  </p>



<p><strong><em>How did you and your team tackle COVID whilst ensuring that service delivery did not fall through the gaps?&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a challenge for every business. First things first, we huddled around a whiteboard to try and gather as much information and input as we could. </p>



<p>We put strong <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/our-covid-19-learnings/">plans in place</a> to ensure we could continue supporting our clients as they would be going through the same thing as we would. We pep-talked our team to brace themselves. We kept the lines of communication open with our clients and assured them that we were going to be here for them; that the hours were not going to be a problem, we would just make sure our clients were ready and able to work where they were able to, mostly from home. </p>



<p>We kept a spreadsheet on the status of our clients and their remote working situation. This required getting constant feedback of what clients needed via the respective account managers. And then we simply rolled up our sleeves to get things going. </p>



<p>The first lockdown for iT360 was extremely stressful as I am sure it was for everyone across New Zealand. We were privileged to be able to continue supporting our clients as an Essential Services business, as many businesses lost that opportunity due to the enforced restrictions.</p>



<p><strong><em>Let’s talk about how you remodelled service delivery in iT360. How does your current team differ to what you had a year ago and why was this shift important?</em></strong></p>



<p>It has certainly been hard to focus on the business this year. So much has been about survival and getting through the next wave of challenges. We had to grow our Service Team from four engineers to eight within the Service Desk due to the demands from our clients as well as the growth we have come to see. </p>



<p>Onboarding has taken a huge focus thus creating a specialised role for Chris Jordan who previously headed up the Service Desk area. </p>



<p>Thankfully for us, Chris has a passion for customer service and is a very talented engineer as well. Overall, I feel fortunate that we have such great members in our team.</p>



<p><strong><em>What words of advice can you offer&nbsp;other&nbsp;senior leaders as we move into the new year?</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>I am a parent of two young kids; I have a wonderful wife and our business has grown from 14-24 in a pandemic. Change is ramping up still in terms of what our customers want and how we deliver. I am sure it is the same in every industry. I think in amongst all the work and challenges, senior leaders need to focus more and more on rest. </p>



<p>Whether that is literally prioritising sleep to be our best selves or simply re-prioritising what is important as opposed to just moving onto the next big thing. There will never be enough time in the day, but we certainly can increase the value of the time we have by bringing a rested, healthy version of one’s self to that time we have been given. </p>



<p><strong><em>What books do you have on your bedside stand or are&nbsp;reading&nbsp;right now that you can highly recommend?&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>How to Talk to Kids so they will listen.  </p>



<p>Perfect Management / People Leadership reading.  </p>



<p><strong><em>What are your plans for this Festive season</em></strong><strong><em>?</em></strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking the new bike out to the mountains, many beach trips, planning for 2021 and trying to figure out how to deliver on all the requests my&nbsp;three-year-old&nbsp;puts&nbsp;forward to Santa when he met with him this past weekend.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Weeding out the right IT support company is an important decision for any business. You don&#8217;t just randomly select tech service providers from Google search. You want to feel comfortable with your choice since they will help keep your business operating without a glitch. You will need a reliable provider to make sure that your network&#8217;s up all the time and that your computers are working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, which company should you pick to address your IT needs? This is the proverbial question, or so it seems. No one can predict the&nbsp;future, but&nbsp;knowing that you&#8217;ve entrusted your network infrastructure to the right managed network service provider is close enough to doing just that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lucky for you, we&#8217;ve narrowed down the criteria so you can choose the right partner for your long-term success. <em>Stuck in a rut?</em> We&#8217;ve got you covered!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>9 Things to Look&nbsp;For&nbsp;in an IT Support Company</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve narrowed down your search to finding the right IT support with these criteria:&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>1. Longevity&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The IT industry is tough; many companies come and go. Finding tech support with a decade of experience is like searching for the holy grail since it&#8217;s a rarity. Those who have been serving their customers this long are surely doing something right for their customers, or they wouldn’t have survived in such a cutthroat world.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>2. Availability</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Which is almost as synonymous with speed of delivery. When you&nbsp;want to keep your technology and infrastructure running at all times, it&#8217;s imperative that your IT support company will be there when you need them. No excuses! It helps to know how responsive they are when issues arise, or if they get the job done right and fast. But, if you&#8217;ve never done business with them, how can you know other than checking out customer testimonials and reviews online? Simple. You can check out their SLA (service level agreement) for you to know what the service metrics are.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. Local</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Don&#8217;t get us wrong; we&#8217;ve got nothing against offshoring. In fact, we&#8217;ve got a couple of remote support helping us deliver five-star services to our clients. But, having someone onsite when your firewall fails, for example, will take faster than getting a third-party vendor which could take days. It helps if your chosen IT solutions provider is nearby when emergencies arise.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>4. Certifications and Partnerships</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>No one goes to combat alone, unless one&#8217;s on a suicide mission. Just like your chosen IT support company, they come with credentials and reputable partners to tackle your most-pressing technology needs. This ensures that you will only get top-of-the-line service, nothing less.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>iT360 and&nbsp;Kordia&nbsp;actually have some personal routes that go a long way back. Our fathers work together back in the technology age, way back in the 80s and 90s.&nbsp; I&#8217;m extremely&nbsp;proud that&nbsp;I can work alongside someone whom my father worked along the side. We&#8217;re both very passionate about what we do, we both share a lot of the same values, and we&#8217;re both driven to get the same outcomes for our customers</em></p><cite>Brent La Franchie, Account Director, Kordia. </cite></blockquote>

</div></figure>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>5. Industry Experience</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Not just in what they do, but in &#8216;Your&#8217; industry as well. It helps to check if they have served other companies in your niche or much better, earned awards in your industry. This means they know the ins and outs of your business, even with eyes shut close, and they can provide a one-and-done solution for your problems.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>6. Diversity&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Related to the previous item, having a wide client base means that the tech support company have went through a jungle of issues so vast you can&#8217;t even navigate your way in it. This means that when a weird problem pops up, chances are, they&#8217;ve seen it before and can fix it in a snap. Unless you&#8217;re in a highly-specialised&nbsp;niche needing specialists for it, you&#8217;re better off working with those who made the impossible&#8230; a possibility.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>7. Reliability</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Everyone promises a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee, but only a few live up to the promise. It never hurts to ask if they offer any guarantees on uptime, or if your system will remain up for something close to 100% of the time. It doesn&#8217;t stop there though. You need to know that you can count on them around the clock so ask if they offer remote troubleshooting and for how many hours/days in a week.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>8. Fully Managed</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Other than finding out what services your chosen IT company&nbsp;specialises&nbsp;in, you can ask if they offer fully-managed services that can provide you a network with excellent Quality of Service (QoS) and a reliable infrastructure to ensure business continuity. Check out what packages they offer to help you&nbsp;on a daily basis, other than their retainer deals.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>9. Custom-Fit</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>At the end of the day, you want to work with someone who truly understands your&nbsp;needs.&nbsp;It helps if you, or someone in your company, have already worked with your chosen managed services provider. Do you know anyone who has a good experience and relationship with them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 2017, we were asked to put up a secure infrastructure that would help transition&nbsp;Farro&nbsp;Fresh.&nbsp; Our good relationship with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kordia.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kordia</a>, that goes a generation back, helped us work together in bringing better outcomes for our client.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With technology constantly evolving, most businesses do not have time to manage all of their IT systems, keep pace with software updates and fix technical problems as they arise. The solution? To outsource all of their IT needs to an external provider. This allows business owners to concentrate on what they do best, while trusting a team of IT experts to work their magic in the background.</p>



<p>That said, partnering with an IT provider does require a certain element of trust. As technology runs through nearly every area of your business, an IT company will likely be privy to the innermost workings of your organisation. This is why it’s essential to team up with a provider who you can trust to provide a professional and reliable service.</p>



<p>Below are five key things to look for in a great IT partner, to help you make this important decision.</p>



<h2>5 Key Things to Look for in a Great IT Partner</h2>



<h3>1. Expertise</h3>



<p>The level of expertise you require in an IT partner will depend on factors such as the size of your business, the current state of your IT systems and your plans for future expansion. Ideally, you want to work with a provider who can act as a ‘one-stop-shop’ for all of your IT needs. The last thing you want is to have to go between two or three different providers to ensure all of your IT requirements are met. Therefore, look for providers who have a proven track record and offer a wide range of services.</p>

<h3>2. Proactivity</h3>



<p>The best IT partners are those who are proactive and solutions-focused. You’re engaging an IT partner because you need assistance and direction, so you want them to make suggestions for improvement and guide you on how to make the most of technology. This will give you peace of mind that you’re up-to-date with the latest tools and trends.</p>



<h3>3. Transparency</h3>



<p>In order for a partnership to be successful, there needs to be mutual trust and transparency. Look for IT companies that are willing to be open about their pricing, processes and abilities from the get-go. Where possible, put your expectations in writing, in the form of setting KPIs at the beginning of your agreement.</p>



<h3>4. Customer service and communication</h3>



<p>It’s important that you get along well with your IT partner as you’ll likely be speaking to them on a regular basis (we all know how often computers, printers and other devices tend to malfunction). Look for an IT partner who offers friendly, helpful customer service. You want to feel comfortable asking questions and reaching out for help.</p>



<h3>5. Good understanding of your business goals</h3>



<p>Every business is unique and has different IT needs. A good IT provider will be able to adjust their offerings to suit your company’s structure and goals. They will also be able to adapt as you grow and expand, or at least point you in the right direction if they cannot help you themselves. The best partner will make you feel like you’re their only client, even if they have several. It’s this personal, proactive support that makes outsourcing your IT needs well worth the cost.</p>

<p>When it comes to setting budgets, cost-effective IT is typically a high priority for management – why pay more for something if you don’t need to? </p>



<p>Here’s how to manage the budget, while still ensuring IT remains efficient and effective for your business.</p>

<h2>5 Ways to Manage Your IT Budget</h2>



<h3 id="unexpected">Planning for the unexpected</h3>



<p>When it comes to managing an IT budget, it is important to set aside a percentage for the unexpected. It is not uncommon for every business to encounter something unforeseen when it comes to their technology, no matter how prepared they are.</p>



<p>It can, and does happen, and has a tendency to cause stress within management when there needs to be an over-budget spend. So minimise this issue by always having a safety net of allocation.</p>



<h3 id="innovation">Maintenance vs innovation</h3>



<p>IT spend is no longer just about <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure/">maintaining technology</a> in your business – the most successful companies these days are the ones who leverage IT to be innovative and forward-thinking.</p>



<p>When it comes to setting your budget, plan for continuing with regular maintenance to ensure daily tasks are able to be carried out. But also allocate spend for <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">technology that can assist you with growing your business</a> – because this is one of the best investments you can make. It’s certainly not something you want to miss out on just because you didn’t ‘budget for it’. And if you go one step further, by working out the expected ROI on the investment, you’ll no doubt see why innovation is an essential part of your IT spend.</p>



<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-use-it-to-increase-business-profitability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to: Use IT to increase business profitability</a></p>



<h3 id="business">Aligning business strategy and IT spend</h3>



<p>Business strategies and the IT budget should always go hand-in-hand. These days, where almost every business function has an element of technology intrinsically linked to it, there is no setting of one aspect without the other.</p>



<p>If your business plans to expand by 50 per cent over the next three years – what affect will this have on IT? What new software or hardware will be required to support the growth, and what implications will that have on the budget?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can plan these aspects before they arise, then there is less of an issue when it comes to actioning those items, and having to spend more than what was allocated.</p>



<h3 id="other_departments">Ensure every department is covered</h3>



<p>When it comes to setting an IT budget, you need to make sure all departments of the business are able to provide input into where they may require spend. The marketing department may need a new CRM system to roll out their next stage of development, or finance may be looking to purchase new software system for the accounts – and of course, these require a portion of the IT budget.</p>



<p>Rather than thinking about IT as its own separate entity, consider how it impacts on the plans of all other functions of the business.</p>



<h3 id="outsourcing"><strong>Could outsourcing be budget-friendly?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>One of the best things you can do for your IT budget is work out if outsourcing a part of it (or even all of it) is going result in cost-effectiveness.</p>



<p>There is no point in assuming outsourcing will cost more unless you have actually done your research with a range of providers to understand what is available – you might be quite surprised!</p>

<p>There really is no doubt that IT in any business today is a critical component to get right in order to grow and have an edge over competitors.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s some of the news headlines over the past couple of years:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/76472117/technology-risks-a-growing-concern-for-directors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology risks a growing concern for directors</a></li><li><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2475885/elevating-the-conversation--how-to-better-communicate-with-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analytics now a boardroom conversation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3461980/it-trends-set-to-shape-the-sector-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business units flex budgetary muscles as tech purchasing patterns evolve</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/77295880/more-than-half-of-nz-firms-unprepared-for-cybercrime-pwc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half of NZ firms unprepared for Cybercrime</a></li></ul>



<p>But some of us still aren’t doing it quite right, however. </p>



<p>That’s okay – acceptance is the first step. And the next step is about realising that taking care of IT in-house probably doesn’t provide the best results for your business. </p>



<p>And maybe it is time to outsource your IT needs.</p>



<p>After all, you have a lawyer to take care of the legal side of your organisation, and you hire an accountant to look after your finances – so how is technology any different? Especially when it comes to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/">implementing IT that is highly effective, reliable and efficient</a>.</p>



<p>But the key is finding an MSP (managed service provider) who doesn’t just provide a help desk for problems and buys hardware – they need to be someone who can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">work with your business</a> to understand your strategy, and can offer expert advice on how IT can assist to achieve those goals.</p>



<p>By staying up to date with technology, understanding its importance in relation to productivity and business growth, and being <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">open to new IT offerings</a> that are available, 2020 could be your year to achieve success for your organisation.</p>



<p><strong>And what could be much more valuable than that?</strong></p>

<p>Choosing a new IT provider can feel akin to stumbling around in the dark. How can you tell which providers will deliver the best service for the best price? Sometimes, the only way to find out is to ask.</p>



<p>Below are 8 questions to ask potential IT providers before you engage in a partnership. Be sure to pose these questions to several different providers so you can compare their responses.</p>



<h2>8 Questions to Ask IT Providers</h2>



<h3>1. How long have you been in business?</h3>



<p>This is a great question to lead with as it’s specific and straight-to-the-point, yet it also invites the IT provider to give you a little bit of background about their history.</p>



<p>Most providers will likely launch into a brief explanation about how they got to be where they are today, and you’ll be able to glean some interesting facts about their business.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-right-it-partner-for-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 ways to get the right IT partner for your business</a></p>



<h3>2. What’s your company culture like?</h3>



<p>The way a business defines their company culture tells you a lot about what they’re like to work with.</p>



<p>Do they like to have fun or are they more serious types? Are they great communicators or are they very introverted?</p>



<p>Try to look for an IT partner who shares similar values to you; this will make working together all the more enjoyable.</p>



<h3>3. Do you have experience working with businesses in my industry?</h3>



<p>Give them an opportunity to deliver a sales pitch about their past experience and why this makes them a good fit for your IT needs. Ask for specific examples and request to see references or testimonials.</p>



<h3>4. What is your approach to customer service?</h3>



<p>Put their customer service skills to the test by asking them this important question. Those that are confident in their communication abilities will likely give you a great answer.</p>



<h3>5. What is your protocol for dealing with software malfunctions or security threats?</h3>



<p>Every now and then, something will go wrong – that’s an inevitable reality of IT! The key question is: how will your IT provider react in a crisis?</p>



<p>Ask them to explain their process.</p>



<p>Ideally, their answer will leave you feeling reassured about their level of expertise and readiness to handle any challenge that comes their way.</p>



<h3>6. What are your rates and are there any hidden costs I should be aware of?</h3>



<p>It’s impossible to budget for IT needs if you don’t know what you’re up for. Ask your potential IT provider to outline their fees and let you know about any hidden costs.</p>



<p>Clarify how they charge for their services. For example, do they charge per hour or on a subscription basis?</p>



<h3>7. Here’s a basic overview of my current IT set-up. What would you change and why?</h3>



<p>This question is a bit of a tricky one.</p>



<p>Give them a rundown of your current IT infrastructure and ask them to come up with some ideas for improvement. This tests whether they are proactive and keen to help you do your best, or whether they are too busy to go the extra mile.</p>



<h3>8. When can you start?</h3>



<p>Last but not least, find out when they can get started and check whether or not they have a waiting list or a lengthy onboarding time. This closing question also gives them a chance to make a final sales pitch and show you how keen they are for your business.</p>

<p>Are you getting ‘bang for your buck’ from your IT company? If you’ve been working with the same company for a long time, you might want to conduct an audit to ensure you are still being provided with great service when compared to other suppliers on the market.</p>



<p>This may feel slightly awkward, but it makes good business sense – and your IT company need not know that this is what you’re doing. Through careful observation and asking the right questions, you can gauge if you’re still being well-looked after – or if you need to shop around for another supplier.</p>



<p>Below are five simple tips to get your audit off to a great start.</p>



<h2>5 Steps to Audit Your Existing IT Provider</h2>



<h3>1. Revisit the paperwork</h3>



<p>Dust off the initial contract you signed with your IT supplier and see if they are still providing you with the stellar service they promised at the beginning. Some things may have slipped over the years without you realising.</p>



<p>By taking a look at the contract, you can identify any gaps in service and take note of areas for improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-should-set-kpis-for-your-it-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why you should set KPIs for your IT company</a></p>



<h3>2. Increase communication</h3>



<p>As the old saying goes, ‘the squeaky wheel always gets the oil’.</p>



<p>If you hardly ever check in with your IT company, they might presume you’re happy with the level of service and divert some of their resources elsewhere.</p>



<p>Start reaching out more and monitor their response. Are they proactive and willing to help? Or do they take days to reply to a simple email?</p>



<h3>3. Introduce KPIs</h3>



<p>As&nbsp;discussed in a previous blog post, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-should-set-kpis-for-your-it-company/">introducing KPIs</a> is a great way to hold your IT company accountable for the service they promise to provide.</p>



<p>You wouldn’t go years without measuring the performance of your employees, so try to think of external contractors in the same light. The KPIs don’t need to be complicated or difficult; they are merely a way to agree on your expectations, in writing, so your IT supplier is aware of the level of service you require.</p>



<h3>4. Assess their readiness for growth</h3>



<p>When you were first starting out, you would have chosen an IT supplier that was perfectly suited to a small start-up.</p>



<p>Now that you are a fully-fledged business with several employees and big goals, you need to check whether your IT company can keep up with the pace of your growth. Do they have the infrastructure and resources to help you innovate? If not, it might be time to move on.</p>



<h3>5. Reevaluate&nbsp;rates</h3>



<p>Since entering into an agreement with your IT supplier, the ‘going rate’ for IT assistance may have fluctuated slightly. There is the chance that another company may be able to offer you the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-do-i-find-the-right-level-of-services-for-my-it-budget/">same level of service for a lower price</a>, or that some more innovative players may have entered the market.</p>



<p>There’s no harm in shopping around and asking other IT providers for a quote, just to see what else is out there. Even if you do decide to stick with your current supplier, it’s always good to have an idea of where the market is heading for future reference.</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-must-measure-it-productivity-in-your-business/">Fast, streamlined and efficient IT systems</a> underpin most successful, modern businesses. As a result, your IT provider often feels less like an external agency, and more like part of your team.</p>



<p>Chances are you speak to them multiple times a week, if not a day! Therefore it makes sense to put processes in place to manage and nurture this key professional relationship.</p>



<p>It is good business practice to set KPIs you can both agree on, ensuring that expectations are met on both sides. This way, you can measure which processes work well and which ones require some adjustment. As the old saying goes, “if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”.</p>

<p>Setting KPIs will help you work together as a team to tackle IT challenges as they arise. It will also go a long way to minimise the risk of confusion or conflict. Problems will be solved swiftly and professionally, creating a harmonious work environment for all involved.</p>



<p>Every business is different, so the KPIs you choose will likely be unique to your requirements and objectives. However, below are three common KPIs which apply to most industries and business types. These are a good place to start.</p>



<p>And if you already have an existing IT provider, you can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-to-expect-from-outsourced-it-are-you-getting-bang-for-your-buck/">perform an audit</a> by following these steps.</p>



<h2>3 KPIs You Should Set With Your IT Provider</h2>



<h3>1. Response time and communication</h3>



<p>This is a great KPI as it’s an opportunity for you and your IT provider to set some ground rules for general communication. Together, agree on reasonable response times, so you’ll know how long it will take to receive a reply to requests. This will save you calling every five minutes for an update (which is time-consuming for both parties), and ensure you have realistic expectations.</p>



<p>You might want to set several ‘response time categories’. For example, urgent requests may require a 5-hour response time, while non-urgent requests may be handled within two days.</p>



<p>While on the topic of communication, you should also check with your IT provider as to the best way to contact them when there’s a problem. For example, do they prefer a phone call, an email or that you lodge a ticket via a software system?</p>



<p>By acknowledging their preferred method of communication, you are more likely to get prompt, efficient service.</p>



<h3>2. Average time spent from initial request to final resolution</h3>



<p>This KPI measures the average length of time it takes for your IT provider to resolve your requests. As your requests will most likely vary widely, you will probably need to measure this KPI for several months before you can establish a fair, accurate turnaround time to aim towards.</p>



<p>This is also a good opportunity to agree on how your IT provider should inform you about the resolution process. For example, you could request a time estimate at the outset of every project, or perhaps agree to speak on the phone once a week to monitor progress. Again, it’s all about <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/8-questions-to-ask-when-choosing-a-new-it-provider/">managing expectations and keeping the lines of communication open</a>.</p>



<h3>3. Error rate and/or security incidents</h3>



<p>No IT provider is perfect, and every now and then mistakes do occur. When you’re setting KPIs, discuss the likelihood of errors, security incidents and other slip-ups so you know what to expect. If mistakes do occur, put processes in place to handle these in an effective, professional manner.</p>



<p>By discussing possible ‘worst-case-scenarios’ ahead of time, it means you will be prepared in the event something does go wrong – even if the chances of this happening are slim.</p>



<h3><strong>Remember: Put KPIs in Writing</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t forget to formalise these KPIs by putting them in writing and having all involved parties sign. When you sign a contract with an IT company, you should receive a <strong>service level agreement</strong> (SLA) which outlines the work they will be providing; this is a good place to add the KPIs.</p>
