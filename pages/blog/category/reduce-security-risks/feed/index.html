<p>As businesses become increasingly reliant on technology, they are also becoming more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A cyber-attack can be a devastating event for a business, resulting in the loss of valuable data and impact on a company&#8217;s reputation and bottom line.</p>



<p>Each quarter, CERT NZ releases a report of what has occurred across the NZ Business Community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are a few of the latest statistics from their 2021 Q4 report:</p>



<ul><li>1030% increase in ransomware reports from Q3</li><li>$6.6 million in direct financial loss was reported in Q4. 100% increase from Q3</li><li>568 scams and frauds, up 16% from Q3</li><li>Recent DDoS attack on VOCUS, Kiwi Bank and ANZ</li></ul>



<p>If you are unsure about what your business is doing in the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cyber-security/">cyber security</a> arena, we recommend going through the list below and speaking to your IT Partner or your internal IT delegate to discuss and ask any questions you may have.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, prevention is key.</p>



<h2>15 Ways to Protect Your Company From Cyber Attacks</h2>

</div></figure>



<p></p>



<h3>1. Perform a Cyber Security Audit</h3>



<p>The first step in protecting your business from cyber-attacks is to identify your company&#8217;s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">vulnerabilities</a>. This can be done through a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cyber-security-audit/">cyber security audit</a>, which will help you to assess your current security posture and identify any areas that need improvement.</p>



<p>This assessment need not be too cumbersome.</p>



<p>It can be as simple as asking questions about your business&#8217; password policy, what your process looks like when employees are onboarded or leave the company, or what <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">backups</a> you have in place and how they are being implemented.</p>



<p>However, depending on your business size, cyber maturity, and appetite for risk, this could be at the scale of penetration testing and &#8216;white hacking&#8217; in order to make sure your network is robust and able to prevent external threats.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>By understanding your weaknesses, you can take steps to mitigate the risks and make it more difficult for attackers to exploit your vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Knowing where you are right now will help you determine your next steps.</p>



<p>What is great about audits is that they are a snapshot of your cyber security position at that point in time. If you do this periodically, for example, every 6 months, you can see your progress over time.</p>



<p>According to the latest statistics, <strong>71% of businesses that have been targeted by cyber-attacks have less than 100 staff members</strong>; identifying that just because you are a small business, it doesn&#8217;t mean you are immune to cyber-attacks or that you can continuously put a cyber-security audit on the backburner.</p>



<h3>2. Check Your Spam Filters<strong></strong></h3>



<p>One of the most common ways cyber criminals gain access to businesses is through phishing emails.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phishing is a type of email scam where criminals send fake emails that appear to be from a legitimate source in order to trick victims into clicking on a malicious link or attachment.</p>



<p>Once the victim clicks on the link or attachment, they are taken to a malicious website, or their computer is infected with malware.</p>



<p>To protect your business from phishing attacks, it is important to have strong spam filters in place to block these types of emails from reaching your inbox.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>According to the CERT NZ report, phishing and credential harvesting was the #2 cyber security threat for the quarter. In past reports, this was often #1, indicating just how big this threat really is.</p>



<h3>3. Update Your Passwords<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Another way to protect your business from cyber-attacks is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">make sure all your passwords are strong and up to date</a>.</p>



<p>According to CERT NZ, <strong>only 41% of Kiwis</strong> say they always make sure their passwords are distinct, long, and complex when signing up to new websites or online services.</p>



<p>A strong password is one that is at least 8 characters long and includes a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You should also avoid using easily guessed words like &#8216;password&#8217; or &#8216;123456&#8217;.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>If a cybercriminal gains access to your business&#8217; email account, they will be able to reset the password for any other accounts that use the same password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why it&#8217;s so important to have strong and unique passwords for all your accounts.</p>



<p>It is also recommended to use a password manager. This is a tool that helps you generate and store strong passwords.</p>



<p>A tip we often share is to stop thinking of passwords, rather, think of it as a passphrase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example: BananaMouseChocolateTree.</p>



<p>Want to see how long cyber criminals can &#8220;brute force&#8221; your accounts?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Try<a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;entering a few of your passwords here</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="599" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-09-at-4.20.19-PM-1024x599.png" alt="Screen Shot 2022 04 09 at 4.20.19 PM" class="wp-image-9137" title="15 Ways to Protect Your Company from Cyber Attacks 1"></figure>



<p></p>



<h3>4. Conduct Continuous and Frequent Cyber Security Awareness Training<strong></strong></h3>



<p>One of the best ways to protect your business from cyber-attacks is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cyber-security-training/">educate your employees about cyber security</a>.</p>



<p>While you can implement multiple layers of technology to protect your business, there is one component that you cannot neglect; that of human intervention.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say your spam filter (#2 above) caught a phishing email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your staff happens to still &#8220;approve&#8221; or click on these links, they can get hacked, making vulnerable sensitive business data.</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cyber-security-training/">Cyber security awareness training</a> is important because it helps employees understand how to identify and avoid common cyber threats, such as phishing emails, social engineering attacks, and malware.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>According to an IBM report, &#8220;Human error was a major contributing cause in 95% of all breaches.&#8221; This means that even with the best security measures in place, your business is still at risk if your employees are not trained on a regular basis in best practice cyber security.</p>



<p>As a company, do you include cyber security training courses for new and current staff members?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you run phishing simulations?</p>



<p>From a business standpoint, cyber security training is also something we are seeing an increasing demand for, often pushed by insurance requirements.</p>



<h3>5. Implement Advanced Endpoint Detection and Response<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is a type of security software that helps businesses detect, investigate, and respond to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-threats-dont-let-lack-of-knowledge-hurt-your-business/">cyber threats</a>.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional antivirus software, which only looks for known malware, EDR uses&nbsp;behavioural&nbsp;analytics to identify suspicious activity and potential threats.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>Think of EDR as the next evolution of the anti-virus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>EDR agents protect against file-less and script-based threats and can even rollback a ransomware attack. It can detect attacks that have gone unnoticed.</p>



<p>The significant difference between EDR and your standard security software is that the former is more proactive, while the latter is reactive.</p>



<p>We recommend implementing an EDR solution if you haven&#8217;t already. If you need help choosing the right one for your business, get in touch with us and we can guide you.</p>



<h3>6. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires two or more verification factors to login.</p>



<p>The most common type of MFA is two-factor authentication (2FA), which combines something you know (for example, a password) with something you have (for example, a smartphone).</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>MFA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts and makes it more difficult for cyber criminals to gain access. For example, even if a cybercriminal knows your password, they will still need your phone to login.</p>



<p>We recommend implementing MFA on all your business accounts, especially those that contain sensitive data.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We understand MFA adds time when you&#8217;re logging in, but the unfortunate reality is, this is a necessary security step in today&#8217;s world that&#8217;s plagued by cybercriminals doing everything they can to get hold of your data.</p><cite>Craig Hudson, Managing Director of Xero</cite></blockquote>



<h3>7. Have a Patch Management Policy in Place<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Patch management is the process of identifying, testing, and deploying software updates (aka patches). Regular patch management fixes vulnerabilities on your software and applications that are susceptible to cyber-attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think &#8211; servers, desktops, laptops, switches, phone, routers, etc.</p>



<p>When it comes to patching, you need to strike a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-it-issues-are-reducing-your-businesss-productivity/">balance between security and productivity</a>. You don&#8217;t want to be constantly patching systems and disrupting workflows, but you also don&#8217;t want to wait too long and leave your business exposed.</p>



<p>The key is to have a patch management policy in place that everyone understands and follows. This should include a schedule for when patches will be deployed and who is responsible for testing and deploying them.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>One of the most common ways cyber criminals gain access to systems is by exploiting vulnerabilities in software. By patching these vulnerabilities, you can close the door on potential attacks.</p>



<p>Another reason you need to implement patch management is for compliance. This is becoming more necessary to adhere to internal standards and for insurance purposes.</p>



<p>Lastly, updates usually come with feature improvements and reliability. In essence, you increase the benefits you get while reducing your risks by implementing a patch management policy.</p>



<h3>8. Consider Dark Web Research<strong></strong></h3>



<p>The dark web is a place where cyber criminals buy and sell stolen data, malware, and other illegal goods and services. It&#8217;s also where they share information about new exploits and ways to conduct cyber-attacks.</p>



<p>Often when an organization like LinkedIn or <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/" data-type="post" data-id="6618">Canva gets hacked</a>, credentials (usernames / passwords) get sold on the Dark Web for phishing purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their hope is that the password ‘Ted’ uses for Canva is the same password he uses for his Microsoft 365. Now just imagine if &#8216;Ted’ also uses that same password for his banking and social media!&nbsp;</p>



<p>The resulting damage has huge ramifications.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>Regular dark web research can help you stay ahead of the curve and protect your business from potential cyber-attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/discover-email-addresses-used-in-dark-web/">discover that employee credentials have been compromised in a data breach</a>, you can take steps to prevent them from being used to login to your systems.</p>



<p>If you do find that your data has been compromised, you can take steps to mitigate the risks.</p>



<p>Start by talking to your IT provider about this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oftentimes, they have tools available to find leaks. These services monitor the dark web for stolen data and notify you if your business is at risk.</p>



<h3>9. Use Firewalls</h3>



<p>A firewall is a network security system that controls the traffic allowed into and out of your network. It is a critical component of your cyber security strategy as it can help block malicious traffic and protect your data.</p>



<p>There are two main types of firewalls: hardware and software.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Hardware firewalls</strong> are physical devices that sit between your network and the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are usually used by larger businesses as they can be more expensive and require more maintenance.</p>



<p><strong>Software firewalls</strong> are programs that run on your servers or workstations. They are less expensive and easier to maintain but cannot provide the same level of protection as hardware firewalls.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>Firewalls are important because they can help prevent cyber-attacks by filtering out malicious traffic. They can also be used to segment your network so that if one part of it is compromised, the rest of your network remains secure.</p>



<p>The firewall we recommend is the <strong>Unified Threat Management (UTM) Firewall</strong>.</p>



<p>The main difference between the UTM and regular firewalls is that UTM firewalls have services layered on top of it.</p>



<p>This is even more important today as you have remote workers coming onto your network and accessing your business data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inside your office building, this is not as much of an issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when you have staff accessing your network from their homes (which usually have a less secure network) or at a nearby café, your risk level increases dramatically.</p>



<h3>10. Double Check Your Web Gateway Security<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Your web gateway is the first line of defense against cyber-attacks. It is the gateway that controls traffic going in and out of your network.</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cloud-solutions/">Cloud based security</a> detects web and email threats as they emerge on the internet and blocks them on your network within seconds – before they reach the user.</p>



<p>Implementing a secure web gateway as the first line of defense, removes SSL blind spots, provides visibility into web traffic, allows for URL filtering, and DNS (Domain Name System) firewalling.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>This is important because if your web gateway security is not up to date, you are at risk of cyber-attacks. Make sure to double check that your web gateway security is up to date and that you have the latest version of your security software.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t have one or don&#8217;t know the details, use this opportunity to start a discussion with your IT partner.</p>



<h3>11. Don&#8217;t Forget Your Mobile Devices<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Mobile devices are an increasingly popular target for cyber-attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These cybercriminals are counting on you to neglect this piece of the puzzle. This is why a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/mobile-device-management/" data-type="services" data-id="5131">Mobile Device Management</a> program is highly recommended for your business.</p>



<p>Mobile Device Management (MDM) is a type of security software that gives you control over the mobile devices used to access your corporate data. It allows you to remotely manage and monitor devices, set up security policies, and wipe data if a device is lost or stolen.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>This is important because mobile devices are often used to access corporate data. If these devices are lost or stolen, the data on them could be compromised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With an MDM program in place, you can remotely wipe data from lost or stolen devices to help protect your company&#8217;s data.</p>



<p>In fact, according to a<a href="https://www.symantec.com/security-center/threat-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Symantec report</a>, 1 in 36 mobile devices have high-risk apps installed.&nbsp; That means that if you have 100 employees, at least 2 of them have a high-risk app installed on their phone right now.</p>



<p>High-risk apps are those that violate one or more of the following:</p>



<ul><li>Share sensitive data without permission</li><li>Have excessive privileges</li><li>Are from an unknown developer</li><li>Are outdated</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/growth-of-cyber-threats/">Without a policy or a way to manage these mobile devices</a>, especially if they are being used to access your network and important files, you are at elevated risk.</p>



<h3>12. Implement SIEM/Log Management<strong></strong></h3>



<p>SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and Log Management are tools that help you collect, monitor, and analyze data from various areas of your network.</p>



<p>This data can be used to detect and investigate security incidents.</p>



<p>It uses big data engines to review all events and security logs from connected devices to protect you against advanced threats and to meet compliance requirements.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>Having greater visibility across your historical log data is invaluable. It consolidates logged data into one location and helps you understand how users are spending their time and what they are trying to access as well.</p>



<h3>13. Implement Encryption<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Encryption is a process of transforming readable data into an unreadable format. This ensures that only authorised people can read the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encrypting files helps <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protecting-critical-data-in-your-business/">prevent tampering or un-authorised access while files</a> are in transit and at rest.</p>



<p>There are two types of encryption:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Symmetric-key encryption</strong>: Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data.</li><li><strong>Asymmetric-key encryption</strong>: Uses a different key to encrypt and decrypt data. The keys are generated together and are mathematically related. Typically, using this type of technology solves this for you.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>These proven safe tools can be found, as examples, on HP laptops and connected to Microsoft’s 365 software.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>This is important because encryption helps protect your data from being accessed by un-authorised people. If your data is encrypted, even if it is intercepted, the person who intercepts it will not be able to read it.</p>



<p>As an example, think of this as sending a letter in an envelope via mail.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no encryption other than the letter being inside the envelope. Anyone can simply open the envelope and by doing so, access and read the letter.</p>



<p>But with encryption, you add a layer of protection so that even if someone gets access to that letter, they will not be able to understand it.</p>



<h3>14. Create a Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan<strong></strong></h3>



<p>A <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">backup</a> is a copy of your data that you can use to restore your files in the event that they are lost or corrupted. A disaster recovery plan is a plan that describes how you will recover from a disaster.</p>



<p>Your backup and disaster recovery plan should include the following:</p>



<ul><li>What data you need to backup</li><li>How often you will back up your data</li><li>Where you will store your backups</li><li>How you will recover your data in the event of a disaster</li></ul>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>This is important because it helps ensure that you can recover from a disaster. If your data is lost or corrupted, you can use your backups to restore your files and resume business almost immediately.</p>



<p>We strongly recommend following this three-step plan:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Backup local</li><li>Backup to the cloud</li><li>Test your backups often</li></ol>



<p>Remember, replication is not a backup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you have your files in OneDrive. You can access them on your phone, tablet, desktop, laptop in your office, during your vacation or where-ever you may be working.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a replication of files, not a backup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to your IT provider to gain a better understanding of backups and how you can implement it securely for your business.</p>



<h3>15. Get Cyber Insurance<strong></strong></h3>



<p>Cyber insurance is insurance that covers losses resulting from cyber-attacks. It can help cover the cost of data breaches, cyber extortion, and other types of attacks.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, having multiple layers of protection can only reduce your risks. There is no 100% failsafe way to ensure that your systems or data will not be compromised. So, if all else fails, protect your income and business with cyber damage and recovery insurance policies.</p>



<h4>Why Is This Important?<strong></strong></h4>



<p>This is important because it can help reduce the financial impact of a cyber-attack. Cyber insurance can help cover the cost of restoring lost data, repairing damaged systems, and other expenses associated with an attack.</p>



<p>When choosing a cyber insurance policy, be sure to read the fine print and understand what is covered and what is not. Some policies only cover certain types of attacks or losses, so it is important to know what you are buying.</p>



<p>One thing we do know from talking to insurance brokers, it is getting more difficult to obtain cyber insurance without first making sure various practices (like the ones mentioned in this post) are implemented in your business.</p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>There are many ways that you can protect your company from cyber-attacks. Implementing these security related measures will help reduce your risk of being compromised.</p>



<p>Simply your cyber security should concentrate on the big 3.</p>



<p>Technology, Processes, and People.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neglecting one of these will leave your business at elevated risk. But by taking a comprehensive approach, you can build a strong defense against cyber-attacks.</p>

<p>SMBs often struggle to compete with big brands. Apart from having bigger budgets, the main reason for this is big brands have discovered a secret — something that SMBs are still figuring out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern and successful New Zealand businesses have three things in common:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>More productive than others</li><li>At low risk of getting hacked and breached</li><li>Laser-focused on their customers</li></ol>



<p>As you may have noticed, the successful ones <strong>don’t fight fires everyday</strong>. They focus on the future, rather than on simply surviving the now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the idea is easy to grasp, it’s difficult to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, there has to be systems in place — for everything. That’s how McDonald’s or Starbucks can simply open up a new store and produce the same burger or Frappucino the same way, no matter where you order it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, this takes time to develop. You can’t achieve these qualities overnight. You have to put in the time and effort. You need to invest in people and the right infrastructure and systems. And you need to make it stick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that said, let’s explore the three qualities more of modern and successful New Zealand businesses below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3 Qualities of Modern and Successful New Zealand Businesses</h2>



<h3>1. Increased Productivity</h3>



<p>Modern and successful businesses — those who’ve developed an unfair advantage — are more productive than their counterparts. Apple and Google have employees&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3068771/how-employees-at-apple-and-google-are-more-productive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% more productive than the average company</a>. While there are a lot of factors discussed in that research, what’s important to note is that this increased productivity gives them an edge over other companies.</p>



<p>According to a Bain &amp; Company partner Michael Mankins, “They get more done by 10 a.m. Thursday morning than the others do in a week, but they don’t stop working.”</p>



<h4>Questions to ask yourself:</h4>



<ul><li>Are you constantly hitting your deadlines or missing them?</li><li>What about campaigns or product launches — are you on time? Or always late? Always remember to consider opportunity costs.&nbsp;<ul><li>If you’re set to launch a product/service on March, but got delayed for 3 months, you lost any potential revenue you could have earned during those 3 months. And this doesn’t even include the additional costs you spent during those extra 3 months.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>What’s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/automation-is-changing-everything/">causing inefficiencies</a> in your organization? Is it because of the people? The tools and systems?&nbsp;</li><li>Can you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">work on-the-go</a>? Or do you have to stay in your office in front of your computer in order to do anything?&nbsp;</li><li>Are duplicate files and multiple file versions an issue you face each day?&nbsp;</li><li>Can you easily find other documents, or do you spend hours tracking and locating them?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>2. Reduced Security Risks</h3>



<p>Another quality of modern and successful businesses is they have reduced security risks. In other words, they are not in danger or at risk of getting their data stolen or hacked.</p>



<p>As you may already know,&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;is always in the news regardless of industry:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1 data breach</a>&nbsp;that leaked over 1.2 billion unique combinations of email addresses and passwords</li><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">Canva and PDL Data breach</a> which gives hackers </li><li><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12026395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica Scandal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/toyota-cyber-attack-leaves-employees-unable-to-access-emails-for-days-20190221-p50z70.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Car manufacturer getting locked out of their email system</a></li></ul>



<p>Whether in the personal or social setting, manufacturing or automative industry, or even healthcare —&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">these hacks and breaches are only going to increase over time</a>. That’s why it’s important to have systems and processes in place to prevent and reduce the damages in the event of a cyber attack.</p>



<h4>Questions to ask yourself:</h4>



<ul><li>In the event of a cyber attack, are you prepared to deal with it? <ul><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">Ransomware</a> — where your files get locked up and you can’t access them</li><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">Data breach</a> — where sensitive data (yours or your customers) is stolen and leaked to the public </li><li>DoS — where you can’t gain access to your systems (e.g. getting locked out of your email server, or your website stops working, etc.) </li></ul></li><li>Are your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">staff knowledgeable on the most common cyber attacks</a> and trained to discern them?</li><li>Do you have the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">technology</a> in place to help you thwart such attacks?</li><li>How will you communicate to your customers when their sensitive information gets stolen? </li><li>How are you going to recover your data when they get deleted or gets encrypted (ransomware)? </li><li>How long will it take you to resume business after a disaster? Do you have <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">backups</a> and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">recovery systems</a> in place? </li></ul>



<h3>3. Customer-Focused</h3>



<p>Finally, the third quality of modern and successful companies is they have the ability to focus on their customers instead of worrying something that isn’t in their core business.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110436476581112426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Drucker</a>, one of the greatest management thinkers of the 21st century, said that “results are only on the outside.” This was in the context of most leaders tend to focus on internal processes and systems vs what happens on the outside — customers, partners, the economy, trends, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Successful companies focus on the outside, not on issues within the company like inefficiencies and frustrations brought about by legacy systems.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Questions to ask yourself:</h4>



<ul><li>Are there recurring issues that you and your staff face daily? Like printers not working, computers slowing down or not opening at all, internet connectivity problems, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Do certain activities take more than necessary to accomplish certain tasks?&nbsp;</li><li>Are internal issues — IT, accounting, or reporting performance — keeping you from serving your customers?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Modern and successful New Zealand businesses all have these three qualities: they’re more productive, low security risks, and customer-focused. They don’t spend their limited resources fighting fires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, they focus on what really matters. They focus on their customers. They focus on the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To succeed in today’s highly competitive environment, you need to be forward-looking. Instead of doing more of the same, you need to adapt to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have been avoiding <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> because you think it’s not going to happen to you and our business, well, it’s time to find out if that’s exactly the case. </p>



<p>In this article, I’m going to show you a tool that can search the dark web for compromised
email addresses and passwords in your entire organisation.
</p>



<p>Now, there’s no more guessing about what-if scenarios and whether the risks of cyber security is real or not. </p>



<p>Interested? Read on&#8230;
</p>



<h2>The Dark Web
</h2>



<p>If you aren’t familiar, the <strong>dark web</strong> is a small part of the internet where illegal activities are conducted. In short, these is where hackers and criminals buy and sell information. </p>



<p>Your information.</p>



<p>Let that sink in for one second. </p>



<p>Your personal, identifiable information is sold/traded around by people without you knowing
about it.
</p>



<p>The why and how isn’t important at this point. But what matters to you as leaders in your
organisation is to know which accounts have been compromised.
</p>



<p>These data can be in the form of: </p>



<ul><li>email addresses and passwords — including where you use them: social media, bank accounts, email</li><li>the address you live</li><li>credit card numbers</li></ul>



<h2>Real Threats to Your Organisation</h2>



<h3>Example 1: Impersonating Your CEO</h3>



<p>What if a cyber criminal gets hold of your CEO’s or president’s email. </p>



<p>The hacker can easily send an email to treasury to pay a certain bank account immediately; otherwise, a shipment will be blocked, or a lawsuit might happen which will inevitably cost more. </p>



<p>As the person in treasury receiving that email, what do you think he/she would do? Note that the email is valid — it came directly from the CEO or president. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a variety of tactics used here namely <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#social-engineering">social engineering</a> (impersonating the CEO) and probably taking advantage of a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#data-breach">data breach</a> or lack of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#mfa">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>. Learn more about these <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">common cyber security terms</a> here.</p>



<h3>Example 2: Knowing Your Every Move</h3>



<p>If the previous example might sound unrealistic, how about this more subtle way of hacking. Watch this video…</p>



<p>The video describes multi-factor authentication (MFA) but presents a real-life scenario of a customer finding out that an email forwarding address has been set up in the account without their knowledge. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kxlgfmbu2t.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_kxlgfmbu2t videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kxlgfmbu2t/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="swatch" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" title="Discover Which Email Addresses in Your Organisation Are Being Used in the Dark Web by Cyber Criminals 5"></div></div></div></div>



<p>Now, imagine someone gaining access to all your emails and conversations? From your loved ones, your work, etc. </p>



<p>Now, that person would have known who you’re talking to, where you’re going, where you live, what projects you’re working on, and possibly the thoughts inside your head. </p>



<p>What do you think will happen if the project you’re working in is leaked to your competitors? What if someone posted sensitive </p>



<p>These are just a few examples of how serious the ramifications are and why you need to
prioritize cyber security in your organization.
</p>



<h2>Want to Find Out the Compromised
Accounts in Your Organisation?
</h2>



<p>At the beginning of this article, I told you about a tool that we use that searches for compromised email addresses and passwords. </p>



<p>Basically, the only thing you need to enter is your website.
</p>



<p>What this tool does is search the dark web for the email addresses in your domain and
compile them into a PDF report.
</p>



<p>Here’s what it looks like with the email addresses and passwords masked. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="916" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_11_23_19__3_51_PM-1024x916.png" alt="Sample Report with Passwords Hidden" class="wp-image-6629" title="Discover Which Email Addresses in Your Organisation Are Being Used in the Dark Web by Cyber Criminals 6"></figure>



<p>This report will display the email address, the password, when it was discovered/used in
the dark web, and where it happened (source of breach).
</p>



<p>For the purpose of this article, I masked/hid the emails and passwords. But, in the report that you’ll get from us, you will actually be able to see these passwords. This will give you specific, actionable steps on what to do in order to protect you and your business. </p>



<h2>Why You Should Take Action Right
Now
</h2>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, the implications of a breach is great. If your passwords are out there for everyone to see, there&#8217;s no telling what they&#8217;ll do with it. </p>



<p>Ok, you might tell yourself, &#8220;these are business email addresses, I’m pretty sure this won’t affect me personally.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think again.
</p>



<p>At least <strong>83% of people reuse their passwords across multiple services</strong>.</p>



<p>Just take a look at the <em>password column </em>of the image above. You’d notice that there are several instances of the same email address compromised with the same password. </p>



<p>Now, answer these questions:</p>



<ol><li>Do you reuse your passwords? </li><li>How often do you change your passwords? </li></ol>



<p>If you&#8217;re most people, you&#8217;re probably using the same password across the same set of services. For example, one password for all your online banking, and another for your social media accounts. </p>



<p>But even if you don’t reuse your passwords, or change them regularly, as leaders in your organisation you have to look at this from a bigger perspective. </p>



<p>The fact is most of the people in your organisation reuse their passwords. And that puts your entire business at risk. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>83% of people reuse their passwords across multiple services</p><cite><a href="https://www.cyclonis.com/report-83-percent-users-surveyed-use-same-password-multiple-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyclonis</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2>Risks Extend to Your Personal Life </h2>



<p>If someone gained access to your business email addresses and passwords, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked/">what do you think will happen</a> in your personal life, given that you most probably use the same passwords there too? </p>



<h3>Financial
</h3>



<p>Consider what would happen if someone can gain access to your online bank account?
They can easily transfer money to certain accounts or use your information to impersonate
you and steal something else.
</p>



<h3>Reputation
</h3>



<p>Or even worse, they can gain access to private information like getting <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/icloud-hacking-not-just-for-celebrities/">access to your iCloud account</a> and see your personal photos. These criminals can easily blackmail you to do illegal and shameful activities for them, or extort you for money. </p>



<h3>Physical safety
</h3>



<p>What if these criminals found out where you live? </p>



<p>What do you think would happen to your spouse and your family? </p>



<h2>Over to You </h2>



<p>We’re on a mission to make the world we live in a safer place, one individual, one organisation at a time. </p>



<p>That’s why we want you and your organisation to get that peace of mind online. The report will give you specific and actionable items that will help everyone in your organisation to be safe. </p>



<p>If you want to learn more about this report, let us know in the comments below. </p>



<p>Fact is, <strong>over 70% of SMBs have been targeted by a cyber attack</strong>. And that’s probably even an understatement. </p>



<p>The latest study by the Ponemon Institute on behalf of IBM found that the average time required to identify a data breach is currently 197 days. </p>



<p>That’s <strong>more than 6 months</strong>. And that’s just the average. </p>



<p>If you don’t have the resources, processes, and tools setup, you might already been
breached and don’t even know it yet.
</p>



<p>Take this chance to put your mind at ease.

<p>Apps abound everywhere. Because
of their popularity, we’ve become extremely reliant on them to get our
day-to-day work done. One such tool is Canva — a graphic-design tool website
that allows you to easily create stunning graphics by simple drag-and-drop.</p>



<p>But in May 2019, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Canva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva suffered a data breach</a> that impacted 137 million subscribers. The exposed data included email addresses, usernames, names, cities of residence and passwords. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_n9n0uton1h videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="swatch" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" title="Canva Website Breach and PDL Data Breach 2019 9"></div></div></div></div>



<p>But, did you know that another
breach was found just last month? </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed data</a> from data enrichment company People Data
Labs (PDL) contained over 622 million email addresses. While this isn’t as big
as the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1 breach</a> earlier this year, this should concern
you more. </p>



<p>While the collection is
impressive for its sheer volume, the data doesn&#8217;t include sensitive information
like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. It does,
though, contain profiles of hundreds of millions of people that include home
and cell phone numbers, associated social media profiles like Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github, work histories seemingly scraped from LinkedIn,
almost 50 million unique phone numbers, and 622 million unique email addresses.
&#8211; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/billion-records-exposed-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired</a></p>



<p>As more and more breaches and cyber security incidents happen, the more we all have to learn how we can protect ourselves online. Below are three things you should do immediately after learning that your data as part of a breach. </p>



<h2>3 Things You Need to Do Immediately After a Data Breach</h2>



<h3>1. Change your passwords</h3>



<p>The moment you learn of a data
breach, especially if you are part of the breach, it’s the perfect time to
change your password. </p>



<p>To those asking, a data breach
or leak doesn’t necessarily mean your account was accessed. It’s possible, yes.
But unless you can speak with the hacker, you can’t be 100% sure. </p>



<p>This leaves you with the next
best course of action — change your password. </p>



<p>To ensure you won’t risk
getting hacked again, we’ve created a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">4-day email course on creating and using stronger passwords</a>.
</p>



<h3>2. Don’t reuse passwords</h3>



<p>91% understand the risk of reusing
passwords, but 55% do it anyway. </p>



<p>Please, if you want to remain
safe online, stop reusing passwords. </p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Because it’s very difficult to
remember unique passwords for all our accounts. </p>



<p>Quick question: when was the
last time you counted how many accounts and profiles you have? </p>



<p>Me? I have <strong>348 accounts</strong>
accounted for. Possibly even more. </p>



<p>Now, if you have over 300+
accounts, which you most likely do, can you remember strong, unique passwords
for every one of them? </p>



<p>Maybe, but it’s no easy feat. </p>



<p>The only way to <em>remember</em>
all your passwords without having to remember them is to use a password
manager. </p>



<p>That’s also the reason how I
knew I have 348 accounts. It’s the easiest way to manage all my accounts — from
email addresses, various social media accounts, WiFi passwords, tools like
Canva, and many more. </p>



<p>Learn how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">use
password managers and stop reusing passwords</a> by watching this free
video.</p>



<h3>3. Understand the repercussions</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinny Troia</a>, a dark web researcher, said &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen all these social media profiles collected and merged with user profile information into a single database on this scale. From the perspective of an attacker, if the goal is to impersonate people or hijack their accounts, you have names, phone numbers, and associated account URLs. That&#8217;s a lot of information in one place to get you started.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. </p>



<p>What information have you posed
on your social media accounts? </p>



<ul><li>Birthdays</li><li>Pets</li><li>Family
members and who’s related to whom</li></ul>



<p><strong>Aren’t these the same
information we use as passwords or security questions? </strong></p>



<p>If all that information is in
one place, it wouldn’t be difficult for someone to reset your passwords and
gain access to your accounts. </p>

<p>Earlier last year, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> implemented a new network solution to improve their security architecture. As a solutions provider, we also partner with other companies who can supplement us with the services we need to  deliver value to our customers. </p>



<p>Enter Kordia. </p>



<p>Upon our recommendation, Farro partnered with Kordia to deploy a new wide area network (WAN). The project also included a new internet connectivity and a new phone system. Watch this interview as Brent La Franchie of Kordia and Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager of Farro Fresh, as they talk about the project. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_pvqi12mkpo videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Kordia Background</h2>



<p>Brent starts off by saying, “Kordia has been around for 70 years. Kordia is known for its broadcasting capabilities, that&#8217;s where our pedigree is, and that&#8217;s where we came from.” </p>



<p>He then emphasizes the relationship Kordia and iT360 has in the past. It’s a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/case-study-farro-fresh-focus-on-customers-instead-of-security-issues-causing-inefficiencies/">recurring theme</a> that we often emphasize ourselves. </p>



<p>“iT360 Kordia actually have some personal roots that go a long way back. Our fathers worked together back in the technology age, way back in the 80s and 90s. I&#8217;m extremely proud that I can work alongside someone who my father worked alongside. We&#8217;re both very passionate about what we do. Both share a lot of the same values and we are both driven to get the same outcomes for our customers.”</p>



<h2>Security Issues That Need to Be Addressed</h2>



<p>Simon starts off by describing the security issues they were experiencing at Farro. </p>



<p>“In late 2017, we had some security issues, and our CEO, Bryce Howard had worked with iT360.” </p>



<p>The security issues faced by Farro hundred them from doing their work. As noted by Simon in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/farro-fresh-protects-digital-technologies-using-watchguard/">another video</a>, nothing’s ever been compromised, but the incursions were preventing their staff to do their job properly. </p>



<p>He goes on to continue by sharing his impressions of us during the early stages of the relationship. </p>



<p>“There was an immediate level of confidence just from meeting with the guys and talking to them about what we wanted out of the relationship and what they could bring to the table.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Brent talks more about the solution and how it was implemented&#8230;</p>



<p>“So that solution was a new wide area network, Awareness we call it. New internet connectivity, new phone system, and also some new security architecture.”</p>



<p>“One of the clear directives was how do we transition them, to this new fantastic network, without disrupting their everyday business? So between iT360 and Kordia, we implemented a network, which sat alongside their existing network infrastructure. And then once ready, we cut that network over to the new network.” </p>



<p>While this may sound simple on the surface, this involved a lot of moving parts from three different parties. Despite this, the switch was successful and didn’t create any disturbance in the operations of Farro Fresh. </p>



<h2>The Results: Simon Looks Back at the Partnership</h2>



<p>“The choice IT360 had made to partner with Kordia for us was the right one,” said Simon. “And the expertise Kordia had available was phenomenal. Throughout the whole process, we always felt that we were listened to. And the focus of my job has changed from fire fighting and repair to planning and future projects.” </p>



<p>“If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.”</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> was experiencing security issues that hindered them from serving their customers. Fed up with this, they started looking for ways to improve the security of their digital technologies. </p>



<p>When Farro approached us with this issue, we recommended to work with one of our long-time partners, WatchGuard. </p>



<p>Here’s an interview that talks about the problems Farro was having and how WatchGuard helped. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_9kktqkmu89 videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>WatchGuard Background</h2>



<p>Kurt Brandon, Sales Manager, start off by sharing some background on WatchGuard.</p>



<p>“So, WatchGuard have been in business for 20 plus years. We&#8217;re one of the original developers of hardware firewalls and our focus all those years has been the small to medium business market&#8230;Also, on distributed enterprise of which Farro comes into that market.” </p>



<h2>The Importance of Digital Technologies</h2>



<p>As with most businesses today, digital technologies is very important. Yet, most businesses aren’t thinking about how they can protect them. </p>



<p>Until something happens. </p>



<p>Simon Foley, Data and IT Man<g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="3" data-gr-id="3">a</g>ger of Farro, shares their experience with having security issues in the business and how it has impeded their ability to serve their customers. </p>



<p>“Farro is a supermarket chain. We have six stores around Auckland, about 350 staff at the moment.”</p>



<p>“Without digital technologies, we wouldn&#8217;t exist. Literally every part of the business we have, including alarms and notifications, is all about having a strong underlying, safe network.”</p>



<p>He then highlights the importance of <strong>proactively</strong> putting systems in place to protect these digital systems&#8230;</p>



<p>“Security is an ongoing concern in any company. Our business has experienced issues with security in the past, and they have impacted the business in quite some serious ways. Nothing&#8217;s ever been compromised, but it certainly had affected our ability to allow our staff to do their job properly.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Having the confidence in our IT partner to provide stuff that gives us security and confidence in our systems&#8230;[it] means that instead of spending the day worrying about what could happen, we can actually plan for the future of the business.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Early Beginnings of the Project</h2>



<p>When asked about his impressions of us, Simon says, “When we met with iT360 for the first time, in January 2018, our impressions of the guys were, that they were very professional, that they were of a size to help us, and that they had the skills and knowledge, and access to other people with their skills and knowledge, to actually provide us with the things that we were looking for.” </p>



<h2>iT360 and WatchGuard Partnership</h2>



<p>“iT360 are our long term Watchguard partner. They&#8217;ve been a gold partner for a number of years. And they also run our managed services offering,” says Kurt. </p>



<p>Having worked with WatchGuard for a long time, we are confident in their products. We also love working with them. That’s why when we were discussing the needs of Farro, we immediately know that WatchGuard is a partner we can bring in to help them with they <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security issues</a>. </p>



<p>“So when they were talking to Farro Fresh they approached me about how we would build a network for them, how we would deliver that, and from there, we viewed the compromise that they&#8217;d had and looked at how we would protect them going forward.”</p>



<h2>Future Proofing the Business</h2>



<p>After a year and a half, Farro has never encountered any security issue in their network. This eventually helped shift their perspective. Instead of worrying about security issues, they can now focus on the future. </p>



<p>“Having the confidence in our IT partner to provide stuff that gives us security and confidence in our systems&#8230;[it] means that instead of spending the day worrying about what could happen, we can actually plan for the future of the business.&#8221; </p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a>, a boutique supermarket chain, was experiencing security issues in their business. This prevented them from serving their customers fully. </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Earlier this year, we interviewed Bryce Howard, CEO of Farro Fresh, about the challenges they were facing and where they are now after working with us. </p>



<h2>Farro Fresh Background</h2>



<p>“So we&#8217;re a boutique supermarket chain that has been set up in Auckland starting about 2006. And starting from one store, small beginning, 10 people, and from there we&#8217;ve grown to six supermarkets, have about 350 full-timers, and we&#8217;re covering most of Auckland.”  </p>



<p>Bryce then goes to explain the importance of digital technology to their business&#8230;</p>



<p>“The digital technology for Farro is imperative for our business. We need a system that is both stable and operational seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and without that, we won&#8217;t have a business.” </p>



<p>And as is often the case with most New Zealand businesses, they don’t think about protecting their data and other information&#8230;until something happens. </p>



<p>“The security aspect is quite interesting. You don&#8217;t realize how important it is until you have an incursion. We&#8217;ve certainly learned the hard way, learned a couple of times that the security of the network is of utmost importance.”</p>



<p>In fact, that’s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">one of the most common myths</a> SMB owners came to believe in — “I’m a small business, no one would target me.” But as you may already know by now, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">most cyber attacks aren’t targeted</a>. </p>



<p>For example, the most common type of attack, email phishing, isn’t sent to a single person or a company. It’s sent to pretty much everyone in the cyber criminal’s database — which <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">most likely would include yours</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. </p><cite>Bryce Howard, CEO</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Importance of Relationships</h2>



<p>One of the feedback we often get from our customers is that we don’t treat them as clients; rather, treat them as family. But don’t just take our word for it. Check out our <a href="https://g.page/iT360" target="_blank">reviews on Google</a>.</p>



<p>David Wilson, iT360’s General Manager, talks about this relationship more. </p>



<p>“We came to work with Farro actually because of relationships. My father had been working with Bryce for many, many years back at Tasti Products, actually. He realized the situation of IT in the business at the time and reached out to us to help. Because of that relationship and the fact that Dad had built trust with Bryce over so many years, it just meant that Bryce could say to us, &#8220;I know you can take care of this job, and I trust you.&#8221; </p>



<h2>Systems Thinking vs Bandaid Solution</h2>



<p>We’ve been in the business for <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">over 25 years</a>. We’ve had our share of comments and feedback from various customers across different industries. </p>



<p>One of the most common issue we often hear is service providers (like us) often recommend solutions to fix the symptoms. And as you already know, targeting the symptoms vs the underlying solutions isn’t a good strategy. While it does seem ok in the short-term, eventually, this creates more problems for the business. </p>



<p>That’s why we always make sure we understand the situation fully before recommending something. </p>



<p>And that was the same thing with Farro. </p>



<p>Dave goes on to continue, “it was a business that actually needed something done in almost every area of IT, and we managed to achieve the entire project in a very, very short window of time, without impacting any operations.” </p>



<p>Recommending one thing might make the problem go away temporarily. But without a systemic approach, that problem will continue to rear its ugly head. </p>



<h2>Focus on Customers Instead of Internal Issues</h2>



<p>When asked about the results of working with iT360, Bryce said “For me, the key proof in the pudding is the fact that we don&#8217;t have to keep on thinking about the safety, security, or access of our computers.”</p>



<p>And that’s one of the criteria every supplier or vendor should be weighed against — do they allow you to focus on your core business instead of constantly putting out fires? Are the systems running and working the way they should? Or do these issues continue coming up? </p>



<p>Bryce continues, “We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. We&#8217;re continuing to have a great relationship and a great outcome from working with iT360.”</p>
