					<description><![CDATA[Advice needed? One of our iPads was stolen 2 years ago and unfortunately we aren’t the most IT savvy people..... Regardless, we’ve just found a local families passwords stored on our iCloud account. We believe these people stole or bought our iPad off someone. We can’t find the serial number for this device at present,  is there any other way we can get the police to prove it is our iPad in case they’ve actually changed the Apple ID by now. Or how can we find out the dates these passwords (30 of them) were stored?
Kind regards,
