<h2>5 Ways to Manage Your IT Budget</h2>



<h3 id="unexpected">Planning for the unexpected</h3>



<p>When it comes to managing an IT budget, it is important to set aside a percentage for the unexpected. It is not uncommon for every business to encounter something unforeseen when it comes to their technology, no matter how prepared they are.</p>



<p>It can, and does happen, and has a tendency to cause stress within management when there needs to be an over-budget spend. So minimise this issue by always having a safety net of allocation.</p>



<h3 id="innovation">Maintenance vs innovation</h3>



<p>IT spend is no longer just about <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure/">maintaining technology</a> in your business – the most successful companies these days are the ones who leverage IT to be innovative and forward-thinking.</p>



<p>When it comes to setting your budget, plan for continuing with regular maintenance to ensure daily tasks are able to be carried out. But also allocate spend for <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">technology that can assist you with growing your business</a> – because this is one of the best investments you can make. It’s certainly not something you want to miss out on just because you didn’t ‘budget for it’. And if you go one step further, by working out the expected ROI on the investment, you’ll no doubt see why innovation is an essential part of your IT spend.</p>

<h3 id="business">Aligning business strategy and IT spend</h3>



<p>Business strategies and the IT budget should always go hand-in-hand. These days, where almost every business function has an element of technology intrinsically linked to it, there is no setting of one aspect without the other.</p>



<p>If your business plans to expand by 50 per cent over the next three years – what affect will this have on IT? What new software or hardware will be required to support the growth, and what implications will that have on the budget?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can plan these aspects before they arise, then there is less of an issue when it comes to actioning those items, and having to spend more than what was allocated.</p>



<h3 id="other_departments">Ensure every department is covered</h3>



<p>When it comes to setting an IT budget, you need to make sure all departments of the business are able to provide input into where they may require spend. The marketing department may need a new CRM system to roll out their next stage of development, or finance may be looking to purchase new software system for the accounts – and of course, these require a portion of the IT budget.</p>



<p>Rather than thinking about IT as its own separate entity, consider how it impacts on the plans of all other functions of the business.</p>



<h3 id="outsourcing"><strong>Could outsourcing be budget-friendly?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>One of the best things you can do for your IT budget is work out if outsourcing a part of it (or even all of it) is going result in cost-effectiveness.</p>



<p>There is no point in assuming outsourcing will cost more unless you have actually done your research with a range of providers to understand what is available – you might be quite surprised!</p>

<p>So, how long is a piece of string? Not helpful, we know, but the thing is, the <strong>cost of IT</strong> in your business needs to be in <strong>direct relation</strong> to what you want to achieve.
Working out how much to invest? Try considering these five factors:
</p>



<h2>5 Factors to Consider When Budgeting for IT</h2>



<h3>1. What part of IT is essential to your daily operations?</h3>



<p>For pretty much all companies these days, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-it-issues-are-reducing-your-businesss-productivity/">technology is required</a> in some shape or form. </p>



<p>However, there are differences between what IT  businesses use, and which is the most vital to their operations. </p>



<p>For online companies, their website is probably the most critical function of their business, and for customer service centres, their phones are probably high on the list of important in-house IT systems. </p>



<p><strong>Figuring out your businesses main priorities</strong> is a great first step to understanding where your spending on IT&nbsp;needs to be allocated. </p>



<h3>2. Is the business in growth mode?</h3>



<p>When looking at the strategy you have in place for the year ahead, what kind of growth do you think you will see? </p>



<p>Because if there is a lot planned in terms of scaling up (or down maybe) then it needs to be expected that this will require a larger level of investment into technology. </p>



<h3>3. How much change is the business experiencing?</h3>



<p>This again requires a look to the <strong>next 12 months</strong> to consider any significant changes that will take place. </p>



<p>Perhaps you are moving offices, or your service offering requires a new programme for greater functionality &#8211; these changes will no doubt need extra resource to ensure there is minimal disruption to your business. </p>



<h3>4. What service expectations do you have when it comes to IT suppliers?</h3>



<p> Do you need <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-right-it-partner-for-your-business/">technology suppliers</a> who are available at all hours to provide one-on-one assistance? Or is cost-saving more important than the service offered? </p>



<p>Your level of reliance on them is likely to reflect on how much you pay for their services, so have a think, honestly, about how much help you require. </p>



<h3>5. What is the business’s tolerance for risk?</h3>



<p>With all technology comes risk – and every business is exposed to different levels of risk that can occur internally, or originate from an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/6-it-virus-and-cyber-security-threats/" target="_blank">external source</a>. And what’s important here is to understand how much risk you are happy to expose your business to. </p>



<p>Of course, no owner wants any level of threat facing their business, but to eliminate issues completely, it will <strong>cost more to have the best systems in place</strong>. So to go back to point one, here’s where you need to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cost-effective-it-how-to-manage-the-budget/">consider how essential IT is to your organisation</a>,  and what effect it would have if you lost access to systems for 30 minutes or a day. </p>



<p>So while the above doesn’t give you any kind of figure to base your IT budget around, hopefully it helps you understand what is most important to your business so you can prioritise your spend where it is most required. </p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to have an <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cost-effective-it-how-to-manage-the-budget/">IT budget</a> that would expand as you needed it too? </p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is an unlikely scenario for most businesses, particularly small-to-medium-sized enterprises that typically have tight budgets attached to each area of their operations – which are set in stone for the next 12  months. </p>



<h2>3 Steps to Determine What Your Business Needs</h2>



<h3>Step 1: Prioritize</h3>



<p>List down what you want to achieve in your business and prioritize it. No &#8220;multiple&#8221; priorities are allowed. List them down, then assign a number from 1, with it being the highest. </p>



<p>Understanding what is important to your business, to help it operate efficiently and achieve growth, is the critical first step to finding the right level of services for the budget you have. </p>

<h3>Step 2: Research</h3>



<p>And next is about knowing what kind of technology is actually out there  – as you may not have changed the way your business has done things in a long time, but new applications, hardware and software arrive on the market every day, and they might be just what you need to create greater efficiency (and in turn cost savings) in your day-to-day operations. </p>



<p>Research is vital to get a good understanding of what’s on offer. This may be done by searching online and speaking to different IT experts who cover a cross-section of capabilities. </p>



<p>And if you really want to ensure you are getting the best service for the budget you have,  you need to compare services and have a good knowledge of what technology would suit your business. </p>



<h3>Step 3: Align</h3>



<p>Then, once you know what you need, it is easier to pinpoint those companies that can provide the service to you – and it will also give you a better ability to negotiate terms and cost. </p>



<p>Depending on how complex your organisation’s technology requirements  are, you might also like to follow incorporate <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.accenture.com/t20151003T004643__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Strategy_4/Accenture-IT-Cost-Reduction-Using-New-Technology.pdf#zoom=50" target="_blank">AccentureStrategy’s model for cost reduction</a>; </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/668829/hubfs/Blog_Images/cost_reduction.png?t=1498446889595&amp;width=1114&amp;name=cost_reduction.png" alt="4 waves of IT cost reduction" title="How Do I Find the Right Level of Services for My IT Budget? 3"><figcaption>For further info on these four steps,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.accenture.com/t20151003T004643__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Strategy_4/Accenture-IT-Cost-Reduction-Using-New-Technology.pdf#zoom=50" target="_blank">check out this PDF</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Feeling overwhelmed? What might be an interesting comparison is looking into whether outsourcing your IT needs to one provider is actually more cost-effective than having to liaise and use a variety of suppliers. </p>



<p>You might be surprised that there are affordable options available, which means you can get expert advice from a single point of contact. </p>



<p>It is likely they will be able to offer special prices for hardware/software/internet and phone systems, and there will be significant savings in the amount of time you spend on managing these different aspects of technology in the business – don’t forget to value your billable hours. &#8212;- <strong>Keen to understand how benchmarking plays a part in setting IT budgets for businesses?&nbsp;Download:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/"><strong>An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity</strong></a></p>
