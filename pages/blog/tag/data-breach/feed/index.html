<p>If you have been avoiding <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> because you think it’s not going to happen to you and our business, well, it’s time to find out if that’s exactly the case. </p>



<p>In this article, I’m going to show you a tool that can search the dark web for compromised
email addresses and passwords in your entire organisation.
</p>



<p>Now, there’s no more guessing about what-if scenarios and whether the risks of cyber security is real or not. </p>



<p>Interested? Read on&#8230;
</p>



<h2>The Dark Web
</h2>



<p>If you aren’t familiar, the <strong>dark web</strong> is a small part of the internet where illegal activities are conducted. In short, these is where hackers and criminals buy and sell information. </p>



<p>Your information.</p>



<p>Let that sink in for one second. </p>



<p>Your personal, identifiable information is sold/traded around by people without you knowing
about it.
</p>



<p>The why and how isn’t important at this point. But what matters to you as leaders in your
organisation is to know which accounts have been compromised.
</p>



<p>These data can be in the form of: </p>



<ul><li>email addresses and passwords — including where you use them: social media, bank accounts, email</li><li>the address you live</li><li>credit card numbers</li></ul>



<h2>Real Threats to Your Organisation</h2>



<h3>Example 1: Impersonating Your CEO</h3>



<p>What if a cyber criminal gets hold of your CEO’s or president’s email. </p>



<p>The hacker can easily send an email to treasury to pay a certain bank account immediately; otherwise, a shipment will be blocked, or a lawsuit might happen which will inevitably cost more. </p>



<p>As the person in treasury receiving that email, what do you think he/she would do? Note that the email is valid — it came directly from the CEO or president. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a variety of tactics used here namely <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#social-engineering">social engineering</a> (impersonating the CEO) and probably taking advantage of a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#data-breach">data breach</a> or lack of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#mfa">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>. Learn more about these <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">common cyber security terms</a> here.</p>



<h3>Example 2: Knowing Your Every Move</h3>



<p>If the previous example might sound unrealistic, how about this more subtle way of hacking. Watch this video…</p>



<p>The video describes multi-factor authentication (MFA) but presents a real-life scenario of a customer finding out that an email forwarding address has been set up in the account without their knowledge. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kxlgfmbu2t.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_kxlgfmbu2t videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kxlgfmbu2t/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="swatch" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" title="Discover Which Email Addresses in Your Organisation Are Being Used in the Dark Web by Cyber Criminals 2"></div></div></div></div>



<p>Now, imagine someone gaining access to all your emails and conversations? From your loved ones, your work, etc. </p>



<p>Now, that person would have known who you’re talking to, where you’re going, where you live, what projects you’re working on, and possibly the thoughts inside your head. </p>



<p>What do you think will happen if the project you’re working in is leaked to your competitors? What if someone posted sensitive </p>



<p>These are just a few examples of how serious the ramifications are and why you need to
prioritize cyber security in your organization.
</p>



<h2>Want to Find Out the Compromised
Accounts in Your Organisation?
</h2>



<p>At the beginning of this article, I told you about a tool that we use that searches for compromised email addresses and passwords. </p>



<p>Basically, the only thing you need to enter is your website.
</p>



<p>What this tool does is search the dark web for the email addresses in your domain and
compile them into a PDF report.
</p>



<p>Here’s what it looks like with the email addresses and passwords masked. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="916" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_11_23_19__3_51_PM-1024x916.png" alt="Sample Report with Passwords Hidden" class="wp-image-6629" title="Discover Which Email Addresses in Your Organisation Are Being Used in the Dark Web by Cyber Criminals 3"></figure>



<p>This report will display the email address, the password, when it was discovered/used in
the dark web, and where it happened (source of breach).
</p>



<p>For the purpose of this article, I masked/hid the emails and passwords. But, in the report that you’ll get from us, you will actually be able to see these passwords. This will give you specific, actionable steps on what to do in order to protect you and your business. </p>



<h2>Why You Should Take Action Right
Now
</h2>



<p>As I mentioned earlier, the implications of a breach is great. If your passwords are out there for everyone to see, there&#8217;s no telling what they&#8217;ll do with it. </p>



<p>Ok, you might tell yourself, &#8220;these are business email addresses, I’m pretty sure this won’t affect me personally.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think again.
</p>



<p>At least <strong>83% of people reuse their passwords across multiple services</strong>.</p>



<p>Just take a look at the <em>password column </em>of the image above. You’d notice that there are several instances of the same email address compromised with the same password. </p>



<p>Now, answer these questions:</p>



<ol><li>Do you reuse your passwords? </li><li>How often do you change your passwords? </li></ol>



<p>If you&#8217;re most people, you&#8217;re probably using the same password across the same set of services. For example, one password for all your online banking, and another for your social media accounts. </p>



<p>But even if you don’t reuse your passwords, or change them regularly, as leaders in your organisation you have to look at this from a bigger perspective. </p>



<p>The fact is most of the people in your organisation reuse their passwords. And that puts your entire business at risk. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>83% of people reuse their passwords across multiple services</p><cite><a href="https://www.cyclonis.com/report-83-percent-users-surveyed-use-same-password-multiple-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyclonis</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2>Risks Extend to Your Personal Life </h2>



<p>If someone gained access to your business email addresses and passwords, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked/">what do you think will happen</a> in your personal life, given that you most probably use the same passwords there too? </p>



<h3>Financial
</h3>



<p>Consider what would happen if someone can gain access to your online bank account?
They can easily transfer money to certain accounts or use your information to impersonate
you and steal something else.
</p>



<h3>Reputation
</h3>



<p>Or even worse, they can gain access to private information like getting <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/icloud-hacking-not-just-for-celebrities/">access to your iCloud account</a> and see your personal photos. These criminals can easily blackmail you to do illegal and shameful activities for them, or extort you for money. </p>



<h3>Physical safety
</h3>



<p>What if these criminals found out where you live? </p>



<p>What do you think would happen to your spouse and your family? </p>



<h2>Over to You </h2>



<p>We’re on a mission to make the world we live in a safer place, one individual, one organisation at a time. </p>



<p>That’s why we want you and your organisation to get that peace of mind online. The report will give you specific and actionable items that will help everyone in your organisation to be safe. </p>



<p>If you want to learn more about this report, let us know in the comments below. </p>



<p>Fact is, <strong>over 70% of SMBs have been targeted by a cyber attack</strong>. And that’s probably even an understatement. </p>



<p>The latest study by the Ponemon Institute on behalf of IBM found that the average time required to identify a data breach is currently 197 days. </p>



<p>That’s <strong>more than 6 months</strong>. And that’s just the average. </p>



<p>If you don’t have the resources, processes, and tools setup, you might already been
breached and don’t even know it yet.
</p>



<p>Take this chance to put your mind at ease.

<p>Apps abound everywhere. Because
of their popularity, we’ve become extremely reliant on them to get our
day-to-day work done. One such tool is Canva — a graphic-design tool website
that allows you to easily create stunning graphics by simple drag-and-drop.</p>



<p>But in May 2019, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Canva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva suffered a data breach</a> that impacted 137 million subscribers. The exposed data included email addresses, usernames, names, cities of residence and passwords. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_n9n0uton1h videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="swatch" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" title="Canva Website Breach and PDL Data Breach 2019 6"></div></div></div></div>



<p>But, did you know that another
breach was found just last month? </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed data</a> from data enrichment company People Data
Labs (PDL) contained over 622 million email addresses. While this isn’t as big
as the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1 breach</a> earlier this year, this should concern
you more. </p>



<p>While the collection is
impressive for its sheer volume, the data doesn&#8217;t include sensitive information
like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. It does,
though, contain profiles of hundreds of millions of people that include home
and cell phone numbers, associated social media profiles like Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github, work histories seemingly scraped from LinkedIn,
almost 50 million unique phone numbers, and 622 million unique email addresses.
&#8211; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/billion-records-exposed-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired</a></p>



<p>As more and more breaches and cyber security incidents happen, the more we all have to learn how we can protect ourselves online. Below are three things you should do immediately after learning that your data as part of a breach. </p>



<h2>3 Things You Need to Do Immediately After a Data Breach</h2>



<h3>1. Change your passwords</h3>



<p>The moment you learn of a data
breach, especially if you are part of the breach, it’s the perfect time to
change your password. </p>



<p>To those asking, a data breach
or leak doesn’t necessarily mean your account was accessed. It’s possible, yes.
But unless you can speak with the hacker, you can’t be 100% sure. </p>



<p>This leaves you with the next
best course of action — change your password. </p>



<p>To ensure you won’t risk
getting hacked again, we’ve created a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">4-day email course on creating and using stronger passwords</a>.
</p>



<h3>2. Don’t reuse passwords</h3>



<p>91% understand the risk of reusing
passwords, but 55% do it anyway. </p>



<p>Please, if you want to remain
safe online, stop reusing passwords. </p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Because it’s very difficult to
remember unique passwords for all our accounts. </p>



<p>Quick question: when was the
last time you counted how many accounts and profiles you have? </p>



<p>Me? I have <strong>348 accounts</strong>
accounted for. Possibly even more. </p>



<p>Now, if you have over 300+
accounts, which you most likely do, can you remember strong, unique passwords
for every one of them? </p>



<p>Maybe, but it’s no easy feat. </p>



<p>The only way to <em>remember</em>
all your passwords without having to remember them is to use a password
manager. </p>



<p>That’s also the reason how I
knew I have 348 accounts. It’s the easiest way to manage all my accounts — from
email addresses, various social media accounts, WiFi passwords, tools like
Canva, and many more. </p>



<p>Learn how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">use
password managers and stop reusing passwords</a> by watching this free
video.</p>



<h3>3. Understand the repercussions</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinny Troia</a>, a dark web researcher, said &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen all these social media profiles collected and merged with user profile information into a single database on this scale. From the perspective of an attacker, if the goal is to impersonate people or hijack their accounts, you have names, phone numbers, and associated account URLs. That&#8217;s a lot of information in one place to get you started.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. </p>



<p>What information have you posed
on your social media accounts? </p>



<ul><li>Birthdays</li><li>Pets</li><li>Family
members and who’s related to whom</li></ul>



<p><strong>Aren’t these the same
information we use as passwords or security questions? </strong></p>



<p>If all that information is in
one place, it wouldn’t be difficult for someone to reset your passwords and
gain access to your accounts. </p>



<p>That is unless you enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA). </p>



<p>Without MFA, anyone with these data can try resetting the passwords to your accounts easily. Watch this video to learn the importance of MFA. </p>

<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> is a topic you should take seriously,
especially when it comes to your business. The risks and too great for you to
ignore. </p>



<p>In today’s increasingly
connected world, it’s almost impossible to not use apps and other online
accounts. That’s why it’s a must that we protect our data, our business’ data. </p>



<p>For a primer on how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">create better, stronger passwords</a>, enroll in our 4-day
email course. You can also watch this video if you want to learn how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">remember
all your passwords using a password manager</a>. </p>

<h2 id="what">What Is Cyber Security</h2>



<p><strong>Cyber security is the practice of protecting computer systems</strong> — including but not limited to computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, programs, networks — from theft or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data.</p>



<p>Other people also call this information technology security or electronic information security; or simply information security. </p>



<p>Another simple definition for cyber security is that it’s the <strong>protection of internet-connected systems</strong>, including hardware, software and data, from digital attacks.</p>



<h2 id="why">Why You Should Care About Cyber Security</h2>



<p>According to a report by HP, <a href="https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/almost-half-of-nz-businesses-unprepared-for-data-breaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of New Zealand Businesses aren’t prepared for a Cyber Attack</a>.</p>



<p>The reality is, more than <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">70% small and medium businesses have been targeted by a cyber attack</a>. The scary part is that most of them don’t even know they’ve been attacked, or worse, breached — meaning, someone was able to access confidential and sensitive information of your business.</p>



<p>Now, you’re probably asking…</p>

<h3>What Happens When You Get Hacked</h3>



<p>There’s not really a straight-forward answer to this question, because there are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked/">different types of hacking</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, it can be as simple as someone posting a tweet using your business account saying “I got hacked by (blank).”</p>



<p>Or it can be very serious like adding passwords to all your files which leads to you not being able to access them (since you don’t know the password). You will then have to get in touch with the hacker to pay them a huge amount of money. Then they will send the <em>password</em> that will allow you to regain access to all your files.</p>



<p>This is an example of <strong>ransomware</strong>. It’s one of the most common types of cyber attack, which we’ll cover below.</p>



<p>Another type of hacking that has bigger repercussions is when personal information is leaked. This includes social media information, address, and job info like what happened in the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">PDL data breach</a>. </p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Because when personal data is leaked, we&#8217;re now talking about your physical security. When hackers gain access to your internet banking credentials, it&#8217;s only your money that is at risk. You can always earn it back. But when your physical safety is at risk, lives are at stake. </p>



<p>Consider the effects of these actions on your business:</p>



<h4><strong>Problem 1</strong>: Without the ability to access your data, your organization stops working.</h4>



<p>If you and your employees can’t connect to the internet or access your data, your organization stops working.</p>



<h4><strong>Problem 2</strong>: If organizational data gets breached/stolen, it can cost a huge amount of money and create animosity in the eyes of your customers.</h4>



<p>It’s only the first quarter in 2019, these types of news won’t stop soon.</p>



<h3>Costs of Cyber Attacks You’re Probably Not Aware Of</h3>



<p>When your business is involved in a data breach, two things happen:</p>



<ol><li>You lose revenues</li><li>You spend more</li></ol>



<p>The first downside of getting breached is you <strong>lose the trust of your customers</strong> (and would-be customers). This leads to lost revenues for your business. Apart from that, you’d have to <strong>spend more</strong> to recover what was lost in terms of salaries and fees, not to mention the penalties you may pay.</p>



<p>With lost revenues and added costs, that puts a big dent on your company’s profitability. And if you’re a small company without deep pockets, a cyber attack might put you out of business. </p>



<p>According to one <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/cyberattacks-cost-small-companies-200k-putting-many-out-of-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, over 60% of SMBs close shop within 6 months after a data breach and is <a href="https://www.hiscox.com/documents/2019-Hiscox-Cyber-Readiness-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costing businesses $200,000 on average</a>—which includes lost business, regulatory fines, and remediation costs</p>

<p class="toc">The question you should be asking now is, “<strong>are you prepared for a cyber attack?</strong>” If your answer is not a definite yes, then you can benefit from our <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free cyber security assessment</a>. </p>



<h2 id="crucial-areas">7 Crucial Areas of Cyber Security You Need to Consider in Your Business</h2>



<p>Ensuring cyber security requires the coordination of efforts throughout an information system, which includes the following categories:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Network security</strong> is the process of securing a computer network from intruders, from both <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">direct and indirect attacks</a>.</li><li><strong>Application security</strong> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-data-stealing-android-malware-infiltrated-the-google-play-store-infecting-users-in-196-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compromised application</a> could provide access to the data of its users (and your business.</li><li><strong>Information security</strong> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit. This includes <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">protecting your backups</a> as well.</li><li><strong>Operational security</strong> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</li><li><strong>Disaster recovery and business continuity</strong> dictate how your business gets back on its feet and restore operations should a disaster or a cyber security breach that caused data loss occur.</li><li><strong>End-user education</strong> addresses the most unpredictable cyber security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Phishing attacks are the most common threat your staff should be knowledgeable about.</li><li><strong>Leadership commitment</strong> is the key to the successful implementation of any cyber security project. Without it, it is very difficult to establish, implement and maintain effective processes.</li></ol>



<p>One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the <strong>constantly evolving nature</strong> of security risks. This is also the main reason why there’s a shortage of talent in the industry.</p>



<p>And the main reason why you should have a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/free-consult-booking/">reliable IT partner</a> to stay on top of all these changes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/people-pointing-to-laptop-screen-1024x683.jpg" alt="important areas in cyber security no one is talking about" width="512" height="342" title="Cyber Security 101: A Guide to Protecting Your Business Online 9"></figure></div>



<h2>Two Additional Areas of Cyber Security No One Is Talking About</h2>



<h3>1. Mobile security</h3>



<p>Modern businesses are powered by a mobile workforce. As a business owner, you’re always on the go. You’re with your phone 24/7, talking to your customers, chatting with your team, accessing files and emails, and much more.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s vital that you keep your phone (and your employee’s devices) protected — both physically and digitally.</p>



<p>Start by adding a password/passcode to your devices. For ease of use, there are people who still don’t use them. Also, consider using a VPN, especially when using your device to connect to public Wi-Fis.</p>



<p>There have been cases where personal devices were the cause of security breaches. Even without any malicious intent, an employee may plug in a personal USB to bring in some documents to finish over the weekend can become the reason why your business gets hacked. </p>



<h3>2. Internet-of-things (IoT) security</h3>



<p>Technology is continuously making our lives easier and simpler. And it definitely is <em>invading </em>our homes and offices — from as simple as an automatic garage door opener, to the temperature control in your living room, to speakers that can play music and even make orders online; or smart printers where you just send an email to a specific address and it prints out automatically, or programmable coffee machines.</p>



<p>All these are conveniences brought about by technology.</p>



<p>However, they are not without risks. Unlike our computers, IoT devices do not have anti-virus software as their first line of defense.  </p>



<p>If these devices don’t have updated security protocols, a hacker can easily get in and gain access to all your devices. They can see you in your own CCTV, hear you in your speakers, and everything else you see in movies.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s important to keep yourself protected. The best way to do this is to <strong>update your software/firmware</strong> and <strong>add passwords</strong> to your devices.</p>



<p>For more tips on how to protect yourself, read this article on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">how to avoid getting hacked</a>.</p>



<h2 id="pillars">3 Pillars of Cyber Security You Need to Focus On</h2>



<p>If you’re keen on understanding and implementing cyber security for your business, there are three areas (or pillars) you need to look into: people, processes and technology.</p>



<p>This three-pronged approach helps organisations defend themselves from both organised attacks and common internal threats, such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">accidental breaches and human error</a>.</p>



<h3>1. Technology</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">Technology</a></strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/"> encompasses both software and hardware</a>. The most common one you are probably using is antivirus software. But, as you may probably know, none of these is perfect. Some <em>will</em> get through the cracks. That&#8217;s why the other two pillars are important. </p>



<h3>2. Processes</h3>



<p>Processes are your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/no-cyber-security-policy/">policies</a> and how you company deals with online security and protection. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>How you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">protect and backup your data</a>, </li><li>BYOD policies (Bring Your Own Device), </li><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-steps-to-help-you-recover-from-targeted-cyber-attack/">What you do in the event of a breach</a>, and </li><li>How you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">communicate cyber security to your staff</a></li></ul>



<h3>3. People</h3>



<p>According to one study, people have a contribution to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">96% of all breaches</a>. Without any <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyberwise-free-trial/">continuous education on best practices</a>, your organisation could be next. Learn the most <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/">common targets in your organisation</a> and how you can avoid them.</p>

<h2 id="common-threats">Most Common Cyber Security Threats to Your Business</h2>



<h3>1. Malware</h3>



<p>Malware, short for <em>mal</em>icious soft<em>ware</em>, is any software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer. It’s the <em>general</em> term for viruses, trojans, etc.</p>



<h3>2. Ransomware</h3>



<p>Ransomware is a type of malware designed to extort money by blocking access to files/computers until <em>ransom</em> is paid. This is the example we wrote above. In a recent attack, <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/6-things-to-know-about-the-ransomware-that-hit-norsk-hydro/d/d-id/1334270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ransomware caused this company over $40m already</a>.</p>



<h3>3. Social Engineering</h3>



<p>Social engineering is a tactic that aims to convince a user to disclose sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers by impersonating other people. The most common social engineering example involves someone posing as the CEO and sends an email to the accounting/finance department to transfer money to a “supplier.”</p>



<h3>4. Phishing</h3>



<p>Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails (or any other communication platform like SMS or calls) that resemble messages coming from reputable sources with the intention of stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/woman-having-coffee-while-reading-on-laptop-1024x683.jpg" alt="learn cyber security while on your break" width="512" height="342" title="Cyber Security 101: A Guide to Protecting Your Business Online 10"></figure></div>



<h2 id="terms">7 Most Common Cyber Security Terms You Need to Know</h2>



<p>Apart from the most common threats you may face in your business, there are other <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">cyber security terms</a> you need to be familiar with. These terms are often in news sites. A better understanding will greatly help you reduce the risks to you and your business.</p>



<h3>1. Vulnerability</h3>



<p>A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control.</p>



<p><em>Remember the 3 pillars of cyber security above? If one of them, say your technology, isn’t updated, a hacker can easily get in your systems. </em></p>



<h3>2. Denial-of-service (DoS)</h3>



<p>DoS attacks are designed to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users.</p>



<p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/toyota-cyber-attack-leaves-employees-unable-to-access-emails-for-days-20190221-p50z70.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>what happened to Toyota</em></a><em> last February where the staff can’t access their emails for days. </em></p>



<h3>3. Spoofing</h3>



<p>Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.</p>



<p><em>This is similar to phishing in the sense that hackers try to deceive the person receiving it, but the main difference is that spoofing is for delivery whereas phishing is for retrieval. You won’t knowingly download a malware, right? But if someone tricked you into clicking a link, say about your business getting sued, you will most likely click on it. That will then lead to a download of some sort of malware. </em></p>



<h3>4. Adware</h3>



<p>Adware is a form of malware, malicious or not, that hides on your device and displays advertisements on a computer. Some adware also monitors your behavior online so it can target you with specific ads.</p>



<p><em>A common sign that you have adware is when your browser’s homepage changes into something else, i.e. when you open it, a website automatically loads instead of your default page. </em></p>



<h3>5. Spyware</h3>



<p>Spyware is a form of malware that hides on your device, monitors your activity, and steals sensitive information like bank details and passwords.</p>



<p><em>One example of spyware is a keystroke logger, or keylogger (see below).</em></p>



<h3>6. Keylogger</h3>



<p>Keyloggers secretly records what you <em>type</em> on your computers and devices. Employers use keyloggers to watch employees, but cybercriminals use them too.</p>



<p><em>On its own, you can track productivity levels and what people do, but when used maliciously, you can steal credit card information and other sensitive data. </em></p>



<h3>7. Trojan</h3>



<p>Trojans are software programs that claims to do A, but does B instead. They can take the form of attachments, downloads, and fake videos/programs.</p>



<p><em>Taking its name from the Greek Mythology, the trojan horse allows a hacker to get into your system by promising to do one thing (offering to Athena), but also allowing the hacker to do other things (get inside Troy).</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>No one wants to have their emails hacked. But you might already be the next target. You just don’t know it yet. Or, looking at it from another perspective, <b>you might already be hacked, you just don&#8217;t know it yet</b>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> is very important for individuals and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Troy Hunt</a>, about 1.2B unique combination of email address and passwords were leaked to the public. This data breach, called Collection #1, was hosted (now deleted) on MEGA, a popular cloud storage service.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check here if your email address</a> was included in this breach, or in any previous breaches. But whatever result you find, we suggest you change your passwords right now.</p>



<h2>Two Tips to Protect Yourself from Getting Hacked</h2>



<h3>1. Use a password manager</h3>



<p>If you aren’t already, we also recommend using a password manager.</p>



<p>This helps you create unique passwords every time you need one.</p>



<p>One of the main reason we use the same password across all our accounts is we have a hard time remembering multiple ones, much more the complicated passwords such as “sG27FG#sfsdg$%” — which you probably already know is harder to hack and safer than “lucythepug.”</p>



<p>So, instead of using your dog’s name in all your passwords, the password manager will take care of creating unique passwords for you. Most password managers also have apps and browser plugins. This ensures that you don’t spend a lot of time searching and typing for your passwords when you want to access Facebook or Instagram. When you load the website, your username and passwords auto populate the fields. If you have multiple accounts for the same site (like multiple Gmail accounts), you can choose from the list of accounts saved in the password manager, just click on it, then it populates the fields for you.</p>



<h3>2. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h3>



<p>Another anti-hacking tip that we strongly recommend is using multi-factor authentication. This prevents people from accessing your accounts without you knowing it.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, MFA uses another device/app to verify whether you’re really the one logging in your account.</p>



<p>For example, when you login to your email, after entering your password, you will have to enter another code that is generated by the app/device you have chosen for your authentication.</p>



<p>It can also be a simple text message with a code which you then enter before you can access your email, or an app like Google Authenticator, which does exactly the same thing.</p>



<p>Whatever you choose, this is <strong>much safer than just relying on your passwords</strong>. </p>



<p>While you think this may slow you down, that additional 5 seconds will save you the headache later on.</p>



<p>Watch this video to find out how you can get hacked without even knowing it. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kxlgfmbu2t.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_kxlgfmbu2t videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">&nbsp;</div></div></div>



<p>Also, you actually don’t need to do this every time you login the site. If you have your own computer, you can stay logged in your account. That means you don’t have to authenticate every time you use the service.</p>



<p>Just last Monday, New Zealand’s cyptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/investigation-involving-crypto-currency-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptopia suffered a security breach</a> which resulted in significant losses.</p>



<p>As more consumers and businesses depend on the internet more and more, cyber threats like these will only increase. So, instead of thinking that you won’t be hacked, or waiting for you to get hacked before you do something about it, you can start by following these two simple tips.</p>



<p>Change your passwords today.</p>



<p>Use a password manager and enable multi-factor authentication.</p>

<p>All businesses rely on information. Some of it is more sensitive than others, and needs to stay that way if your&nbsp;business wants any success in the marketplace.</p>



<p>So, how can you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">protect your critical information</a> while still being able to do business?</p>



<h2>4 Ways to Protect Your Business Data</h2>



<h3>1. Encryption</h3>



<p>Cryptography is nothing new. Far from it. It’s thought the Egyptians invented it around 1900 BCE to make stories about their pharaohs seem even more mystical. Forms of encryption have been used ever since to protect sensitive data and turn the tides of war.</p>



<p>As encryption technology and methods advance, so do levels of code-breaking, which pushes the drive for more complex algorithms.</p>



<p>Encryption tools on your computer <strong>scramble data</strong> sent over a network, so anyone intercepting your emails won’t be able to read or download files. Only the intended person with the right decryption key will be allowed access. You can also encrypt files as you save them on your server or cloud. Even if someone hacks in, without the proper key the files will be useless to them.</p>



<p>This is also the same technology in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/ransomware-attacks-are-real-is-your-business-safe/">ransomware</a> &#8212; hackers encrypt your files so you can&#8217;t access them. You need to pay them to send you the decryption key, which will then unlock your files.</p>



<p>As encryption methods get more complex, providers have started building encoding tools into more products to make them simpler for people to use.</p>



<h3>2. Back-Ups</h3>



<p>Never keep all your eggs in one basket. If all of your business’ data, client information and financial records are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">stored in the one place,</a> you’re in trouble. </p>



<p>If something affects that computer, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/iot-network-and-endpoint-security-challenges/">network</a>, server or hard drive you have virtually no way to recover. It’s essential to have a regular back-up to protect your business in the event of disaster.</p>



<p>If the worst happens, with <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">regular back-ups</a> you have all your critical data stored somewhere else, and it won’t take too long to get your business back up and running.</p>



<h3>3. The Cloud</h3>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/enabling-safer-cloud-use-in-business/">Hosted cloud storage</a> is a very secure way of protecting your company data if you choose the right provider. Instead of a back-up server at your business, cloud storage saves data on an online server you can access through the internet.</p>



<p>It’s their responsibility to maintain security, updates, and business continuity, and you get the added bonus of off-site storage and good accessibility.</p>



<p>Larger cloud providers are more likely to have <strong>advanced security measures</strong> than most SME’s, and as their reputation is on the line they’re more security conscious than most when it comes to protecting data.</p>



<h3>4. The 3-2-1 Rule</h3>



<p>It might sound extreme, but it’s better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. To truly protect your company data you need <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">three back-up copies, two saved on different media and one stored off-site</a>.</p>



<p>For example, a back‐up hard drive in the office, a back-up server in your warehouse, and a back-up cloud server. Following the 3-2-1 rule protects your business from any single point of failure. </p>



<p>If your company’s national head office or data centre is in Christchurch, you want to make sure the off-site storage is out of Canterbury in case another earthquake knocks out infrastructure</p>
