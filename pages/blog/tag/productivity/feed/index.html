<p>Collaboration software is a crucial part of productivity. But the overwhelming emails and calls make collaboration difficult. Therefore, team collaboration software is the new trend for many organisations. We want to present to you our top choices of collaboration tool. Evaluating them on four characteristics. Here’s a quick summary of our recommendations under six criteria:&nbsp;</p>

<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Workplace by Facebook</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Now, let’s investigate them in details…&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Team</a> &#8211; the ultimate collaboration software.</h3>



<p>It is a chat-based workspace of Office 365. Microsoft Teams combines workplace chat, video meetings, file storage and application integration. Out of all the software in this list, Microsoft Teams is an ideal candidate for businesses that use Office 365 daily (which most of us are).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="804" height="1024" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Meeting-in-Teams-Infographic-01-804x1024.jpg" alt="Microsoft Teams Pro-Cheatsheet" class="wp-image-6356" title="Top Collaboration Software for New Zealand Businesses in 2020 1"></figure>



<h4>Notable Features.</h4>



<p>Microsoft Teams proved that it is a worthy protégé of Skype for Business. Its has all the basics (call, video conferences). Even within a team, designating channels to a different topic of conversation is possible. Microsoft Teams has chat-features like sending GIFs, stickers and emojis. Like SFB, share screens function is a given. In short, it&#8217;s an enhanced version of Skype for Business.</p>



<p>For collaboration, there&#8217;re a few notable integrations include MailChimp, Facebook Pages, Trello &amp; Lucidcharts. Each app can be open in tab. Either with a person or a team, is up to you. Microsoft Offices integrations is a given and using them will be seamless.</p>



<p>In terms of data security, Microsoft Team has Office 365 enterprise-grade cloud. This means it must adhere to the strictest compliance standards and data encryptions.&nbsp;</p>


[table id=1 /]



<p>In between 2016 and 2018, MST users had increased from 3% to 21%. People predicted Microsoft Teams would continue to grow even more by next year. While part of it’s success partly because of its availability to Microsoft Office 365 users. Microsoft Teams itself is too, giving users great experiences:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I use this program for private and business purposes, although a bit more demanding program, it gives me a bit of fun while working.” – <a href="https://www.getapp.com/collaboration-software/a/microsoft-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stefan&#8217;s feedback of Microsoft Teams</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slack</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Slack is one of a few collaboration software that has it all. It is simplistic, easy to use and organise. The impressed feature is how effortless to communicate across teams, within teams and having conferences. Users rated 4.6/5 for its <a href="https://www.getapp.com/collaboration-software/a/slack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Ease of use” on GetApp.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We think Slack prize feature is its integrations capability. Slack has more than 1,500 app integrations, a lot more than most of its competitor. Slack Premium also allows users to access its powerful app builder and API, letting users build any integration desired. This feature alone makes it the #1 choice users who like to customised or design tools.&nbsp;</p>


[table id=2 /]



<p>Slack is great, but not without fault, and its greatest weakness is the security risks. In short, the vast amount of integration apps. Users ability to customised integration is the loopholes. As this function somewhat weakened their data security. The system bug scandals back in 2017 left Slack users with cold-sweats. Most noteworthy is Slack acknowledgement of their failure. As a result, the company is now investing more into their security. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.workplace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Workplace</a></h3>



<p>Facebook Workplace is Facebook’s version of Slack. In a way, it’s like a love child between Slack and Facebook – having the best of features from both. The internal messaging and feeds work the same as its social media side. The Workplace account is only visible to people in the team/company and is separate from personal accounts.&nbsp;</p>


[table id=3 /]



<p>It does all the basic of internal communication: Video chat and call. It is also keeping its social media features of posting and commenting. Users can create groups and adding people in according to the group focus topic. One unique thing about Workplace is its a multi-company collaboration. Meaning that you can add other people outside of your organisation hassle-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="571" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Workplace-by-Facbook-1024x571.png" alt="Workplace measurable productivity" class="wp-image-6354" title="Top Collaboration Software for New Zealand Businesses in 2020 2"><figcaption>Workplace&#8217;s case study on Collaboration Productivity</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite their lack of features. Facebook Workplace is continuing to grow and is growing quickly. They also make sure that their success does not go unnoticed. They did a <a href="https://www.workplace.com/workplace/blog/total-economic-impact-report-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total Economic Impact</a> study on organisations productivity by using Workplace. The research shows promising collaboration productivity growth.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Confluence</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Confluence is one of the first few workplace-collaboration software on the market. It capabilities include creating, review ing and finalised project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Known for powerful search capability, as they put it Confluence is “Wiki Engine on Steroids”. <font color="#b00000">Confluence is one of the pioneers, therefore, it is one of the oldest collaboration software in the market.</font></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="770" height="577" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/confluence.jpg" alt="Cofluence-Collaboration-Tool" class="wp-image-6355" title="Top Collaboration Software for New Zealand Businesses in 2020 3"><figcaption>Confluence is popular for their powerful text-search</figcaption></figure>



<p>This software is content-focused, which means there’s not much internal communication. Users cannot message or call their team, and definitely can&#8217;t host video conferences. Commenting on other’s work is the only feature resembles internal communication. Hence, if you are looking for an all-in-one software, Confluence might not be an ideal choice.&nbsp;</p>


[table id=4 /]



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Conclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There’s no one size for all, each business has different needs and requirements. Hence, it is in your best interest that you test more than two collaboration software. </p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> and Skype for Business are giving many users question, as it often overlaps when it comes to functionality. It does not mean that you must choose one over another. Skype’s ‘empire’ has a new promising successor &#8211; MS Teams.</p>



<p>Will this change anything at all? YES, it will. More and more companies would find that MS Teams isn’t another communication app – It’s Skype x3000.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-group toc"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<h2>Learn How Microsoft Teams Can Transform Your Business</h2>



<p>Watch these videos to learn everything you need to know about how you can use Microsoft Teams in your organisation</p>



<div class="wp-block-button is-style-outline"><a class="wp-block-button__link" href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/teams-in-10-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Access the Videos Now</a></div>
</div></div>



<h2>MS Teams vs Skype for Business: Here’s What You Need to Know</h2>



<p>Both MS Teams and Skype are communication tools used by many organisations to help them grow their business and improve their productivity. </p>



<p>Skype for Business supports voice calls, video conferencing and chat messages. It also offers video conference calls that support up to 250 people. Users can also transfer calls, and dial using real phone number if the other person isn’t online. </p>



<p>In terms of daily use, people can use it for online meetings especially for multi-location offices; or, more recently, because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Skype for Business is a robust communication tool. </p>



<p>While Microsoft Teams have the same calling-functionality of Skype for Business, MS Teams is designed primarily for collaboration. The biggest differentiator is the latter&#8217;s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-teams-integration-with-other-apps/">integration with hundreds of apps</a> that extend its feature set further. </p>



<p>MS Teams users have the ability to collaborate in real-time no matter where they are. For example, Skype allows you to share your screen during a video call, but only one person can make changes to a document. </p>



<p>With MS Teams, whether in a conference call or not, people can work on the same document at the same time within the app. This helps improve productivity because you don&#8217;t have to use multiple software nor have issues with <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">duplicate files</a>.</p>



<p>Microsoft is the provider of both software and part of the Microsoft 365 business package. Users&#8217; data are safe and secured under Microsoft strict compliances and enterprise-grade security. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="679" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Skype-for-Business-2019-vs-Microsoft-Teams-2020-1024x679.png" alt="Skype for Business 2019 vs Microsoft Teams 2020" class="wp-image-6344" title="Microsoft Teams VS Skype for Business: Everything You Need to Know 4"><figcaption>Microsoft Team vs Skype for Business</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Skype vs Microsoft Teams: No Need to Choose</h3>



<p>Microsoft Teams will takeover Skype for Business as internal communication AND collaboration platform. </p>



<p>Organisations are not required to choose between the two. If you are using Office 365 for your business, our only advice to you is to transit to Microsoft Teams as soon as you can.  </p>



<p>For existing Skype for Business users, will have to transition to MS Teams by July 31, 2021—which is the date set by Microsoft to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/faq-journey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retire Skype for Business</a>.</p>

<p>Messenger app is a staple in our modern lifestyle. Businesses are acknowledging the importance of effective internal communication. Different to the personal social app, messenger app use for business requires more specific features and compliances. If you are considering which to choose for your business, here are seven criteria to consider:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question">What are the criteria you need to consider before choosing a messenger app?</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer"></p><ol><li>Multiple device synchronisation</li><li>Encryption and security</li><li>Global address book</li><li>Controlling user access</li><li>Auditing user activity</li><li>Compliance and regulation</li><li>File sending functionality</li></ol><p></p> </div> </div>



<h2>Messenger app needs to have</h2>



<h4><strong>Multiple Device </strong><strong>Synchronisation</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>A modern person nowadays would own more than one device. The ideal messenger app must be available on all different type of devices, and systems. Ex: IOS, Android, Mac and Windows. Most importantly, data synch must apply across all devices.&nbsp;Hence, this is more important than you might think. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="749" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mobile-devices-on-a-table-1024x749.jpeg" alt="Messenger apps synchronisation" class="wp-image-2863" title="Messenger App - How to Choose for Your Business? 5"><figcaption>
						</figcaption></figure>



<h4>&nbsp;<br><strong>Encryption and Security</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Beware that your encrypted message backups are usually not encrypted in the cloud. Any desktop software is vulnerable to the desktop&#8217;s bugs. Hence, the software must be updated regularly. </p>



<p>We recommend that you look into the security system in place, especially data security. For business, Microsoft is known for their data centre and high-grade data security. Needless to say, we prefer providers that stores their data with Microsoft. While Facebook will not be our first choice (second or third). </p>



<p>Read more about <i><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/growth-of-cyber-threats-in-2018/">Growth of Cyber Threats: Preventing Data Breaches in Your Organisation</a></i><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/growth-of-cyber-threats-in-2018/">.</a> </p>



<h4>&nbsp;<br><strong>Global Address Book</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>There&#8217;s a reason why enterprises don&#8217;t use social media for communication.  Social media is not everyone cups of tea. It&#8217;s distracting, unprofessional and time-consuming. Thus, your ideal app must automatically sync the enterprise global address book to each user&#8217;s devices. If the user has to scroll through lists of names to find their colleagues. Then it defeats the purpose of ease of use.  </p>



<p>Moreover, the sign-in requirement should be limited to a work email address only.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Controlling User Access</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>What happens when a person leaves the company? Removing access to the data stored on employee phones in messaging apps is a must. However, this can be a complicated and muddy process. </p>



<p>Furthermore, an ideal message app should require work credential only for access. When deleting the work credential, it should also remove all granted access linked to that credential.</p>



<p>Sometimes security breach happens isn&#8217;t because you don&#8217;t take enough protection-measure. Maybe you just overlook this detail. </p>



<h4><strong>Auditing Users Activity</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>It is NOT about reading people messages or recording calls. However, the organisation need to keep track of users&#8217; activities and footprints.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monitoring of users activity is especially important, especially with highly sensitive information. Therefore, administrative need total control of data access, who can see it and for how long. You did everything right to protect your data, but you may forget about this!</p>



<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Compliance and Regulation</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The policy and <a href="https://www.regulatesocialmedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulation</a> are always the dreadfully long and tedious part. However, having a basic understanding is not being excessive. </p>



<p>You need to understand the basics of regulations, and know the rights to your data. Unfortunate events don’t happen often but they do&nbsp;happen. We as users are not excluded from faults either. </p>



<h4><strong>File Sending Functionality</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The capability of sending files, other than photos is an essential feature of a messenger app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine the file-sending process via email&#8230;</p>



<p>You create a new email. File attachment window opens up. Now, you have to go through &#8216;halls of folders&#8217; before getting to your file. You attached the correct file. Then realising it’s bigger than the file limits.</p>



<p>Isn’t it better, drag and drop? With no size or quality limits?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the end, different from choosing a messenger app for personal use. Choosing a messenger app for your organisation involved many risk factors. The decision is yours to make, but we advise you to consider carefully. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s Our Honorable Mention: <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> – The Powerhouse for Microsoft users. &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More and more business, big and small, are starting to realise the traditional collaborating of calls and emails are no longer productive. Enterprise-grade collaboration <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2471537/beyond-cool--the-cold--hard-facts-on-collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires much more</a> than basic tools could offer. Companies and teams are turning to the latest alternative &#8211; collaboration software. </p>



<p>You may have clicked on this article because you are not sure of how collaboration tools could help your business. Here are the seven reasons to use collaboration tools in your business: </p>



<h2>Top 7 Reasons Your Business Should Have a Collaboration Software</h2>



<h3>1. Time effectiveness </h3>



<p>In business, time is gold, and you want to spend your precious time being productive. Waiting for other people to reply or share – could consume your whole day. The purpose of using a collaboration tool is, in the end, is to stop your business from wasting time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Information efficiency </h3>



<p>Email – the traditional way of collaborating. You attached the newest version of the document. Send it to the intended recipients and wait for their response. The thing is&#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharing files by email is a painful process for both senders and receivers &#8211; especially when you have many people contributing to the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, it can get messy &#8211; overwhelmingly messy!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is overwhelming when there are many version of files, coming from different people at the same time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top collaboration tools would have many modifications, add-ons, bots that allows users to edit the project in sync. Upload your document and assign colleagues or teams to different chapters. They can then work together in real-time to get the content exactly how you want it. For total transparency, you can then use the audit trail to see what changes made and by whom.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. They offer more choice than written material </h3>



<p>In the digital world, it can be challenging to convey your exact purpose and thoughts by writing. An ideal collaboration tool would allow users to send messages, voice messages, screen sharing and send all types of files.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1001" height="225" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DS_Files-Send.png" alt="multiple options for communication" class="wp-image-5914" title="Collaboration Software - 7 Reasons to Have One for Your Business 6"></figure>



<p>A collaboration tool can minimise the number of gadgets you ‘need’ to use, by having them all in one place. Reducing your long list of daily software to three or even less! Just one login and they&#8217;re all at your fingertips. You won&#8217;t need to remember the gazillions of passwords. Wouldn’t that be better?</p>



<h3>4. Makes your project more organised </h3>



<p>How many times did you turn your inbox upside down to find an email? From data, meeting times, and internal communication, the amount of information we need to keep track of&nbsp;is vast.</p>



<p>Sometimes it isn’t about personality, you just haven’t use the right tool yet. Being organised is a competitive advantage, and no company should take it for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="344" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DS_Files-Section-1024x344.png" alt="Files and documents in one place" class="wp-image-5916" title="Collaboration Software - 7 Reasons to Have One for Your Business 7"></figure>



<p>Once you logged in, conference call facilities, calendars, and tasks management allow you to carry out your meeting. You can even send meeting reminders or reminders of all sorts to everyone. Isn’t it much better than sending emails, and hoping people would remember?</p>



<h3>5. Security </h3>



<p>Security is especially important when you’re handling the sensitive part of the project. Thinking about the serve consequences of data breach may already be giving you shivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emails can be vulnerable to data breaches, however, a collaboration tool will give you absolute control over your data. You will decide who has the permission to access it and for how long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>6. Reduce stress </h3>



<p>Managing a project is never easy and unnecessary clutters don’t help. That’s why organisations need collaboration tools. To relieve managers from unproductive complexity, simply by facilitating communication and empower accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collaboration tools allow you to see everyone&#8217;s work, and them being able to see yours. The exchange of information, ideas and comments becomes easier and faster. Being able to see progress will likely reduce your stress, and it can lift your team spirit too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>7. Staying on budget </h3>



<p>Staying on budget is a common goal for all managers. The capability to track history and progress would help managers divide resources better. Most collaboration software would allow managers to be on top of all the milestones, process, status and the content of each project.  </p>



<p>Other surprising peaks are travel costs saving. Whether it is domestic or international travel, it can be expensive, especially for extended periods&nbsp;of time. That’s why collaboration software is the solution. You can work at any time or location. </p>



<p>Do you think collaboration tool is needed in your organisation? If you do,</p>

<p>The WiFi goes down, again, so what happens? Your team has to stop work – there’s nothing they can do if they&nbsp;are offline&#8230;</p>



<p>A computer goes down and after trying a variety of things to fix it, it has to go to the shop. Without a spare lying around, what can your employee do?&#8230;</p>



<p>You know there needs to be an upgrade of the software you are using – but it’s a big cost and you don’t even know where to start&#8230;</p>



<p>Sound familiar? And the hard-hitting truth is that all of these IT issues, they are reducing your business’s productivity levels, which in turn, translates to a loss of profit.</p>



<p>Read more: <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" label=" (opens in a new tab)">Poor IT will cost a business significantly &#8211; here&#8217;s how to do IT the right way</a></p>



<h2>5 IT Issues Reducing You`r Producitivity</h2>



<h3>1. Time-consuming access to data</h3>



<p>Whether you are a customer-centric organisation, in FMCG warehousing, or provide essential service maintenance – having data to work with is imperative. But if there is any delay in accessing it when required, it can cause a series of flow-on effects.</p>



<p>Also extremely time-consuming is accessing data when a business has multiple programmes that carry out different tasks and hold different information. Not having software integrated (especially when it is possible) can result in delays, and a less effective process being carried out – a place where errors can easily occur.</p>



<h3>2. Unreliable email</h3>



<p>Have you ever had a customer or client say ‘Did you not get my email last week?’ Or you have sent one with important information, only to have it delayed due to issues with your mail provider?</p>



<p>Billions of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/office-365/">business emails</a> are sent on a daily basis and you probably don’t care about 99.9% of them. But you do want to know you are able to send and receive the ones that are imperative for your business to function, as the consequence of them ‘disappearing into a black hole’ can be extremely detrimental – what is the cost of missing out on a potential customer lead or losing clients due to lack of reliable communication?</p>



<h3>3. Intermittent outages</h3>



<p>Sometimes our <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/internet-services/">business networks, WiFi or access</a> to particular programmes can go down for an unknown reason – too many people in the system you use, an unreliable internet provider, or issues affecting software that need to be fixed by the manufacturer.</p>



<p>Whatever the case may be, none of these situations is helpful for productivity flow and function – particularly when they are unexpected, and occur regularly.</p>



<h3>4. Slow or old software/hardware</h3>



<p>Having a slow computer to work with on a daily basis is extremely frustrating for the individual – but it actually means a lot more to the business as a whole. If software and hardware are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-2008-end-of-support/">out of date</a>, you could experience problems with work functionality and expose your organisation to a greater risk of security threats.</p>



<p>If an employee’s computer takes five minutes to load each day, that is 25 minutes a week wasted. (Not counting if it crashes has to be restarted.)</p>



<h3>5. Isolation of IT department/personnel</h3>



<p>In many organisations, the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/">IT department</a> is seen as a place you can’t access freely. Raising issues can be time-consuming, and sometimes resolutions are slow to be actioned &#8211; not too mention there is often tension when it comes to communication between non-IT individuals and IT personnel (sound familiar?).</p>



<p>Some of the examples mentioned above may seem small, recurrent issues that are unlikely to have a big&nbsp;impact on your the bottom line. But when you look at it more closely – the lost time and the reduction in business productivity&nbsp;that it causes – is it really insignificant?</p>

<p>Technology is no longer a stand-alone function within a business – well, it shouldn’t be. That is because for most organisations today, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-it-issues-are-reducing-your-businesss-productivity/">IT productivity</a> has a direct correlation with profit, and output efficiency.</p>



<p>So for a business owner or General Manager to not have an understanding of how technology affects the overall proficiency of their organisation, there is a very real risk that tasks and processes won’t be undertaken at the maximum level possible.</p>



<p>One of the first things to work out for your organisation is <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/">what productivity actually means</a> to your business. How do you measure it and what goals/KPIs do you have around the output of your team?</p>



<p>Once you know the end outcome, then you can work backwards to understand the process of throughput – i.e. the stages that are undertaken to complete the end product or service.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/stop-making-these-5-it-mistakes-in-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stop making these 5 IT mistakes in your business</a></p>



<p>These step-by-step actions should then provide a more detailed knowledge around how technology is involved in the working method. And once you know where IT fits in, you can then <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/business-technology-you-should-be-implementing/">directly correlate</a> it to where the technology works well, and where it lacks efficiency – enabling you to get a firm insight into how the IT systems affect productivity in your business.</p>



<p>From here there will then be options to streamline processes, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/automation-is-changing-everything/">introduce automation</a> (or further automate functionalities) and limit any areas where technology might be having a negative impact on productivity – for example if your business computers take 2 minutes to load in the morning, and you have 50 staff, then that is more than an hour of lost time in one working day.</p>



<p>After completing these activities (which could take a little while) it is then important to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/">consider ROI</a> of any investments you do decide to make into IT. Of course this can even be done before you make a decision on what to implement by estimating how it will impact on the output by calculating the increase in productivity.</p>



<p>Want to brainstorm some ways your business might be able to benefit from better IT systems? Consider the following:</p>



<ol><li>Investigate your ISP/internet speed and check it is running at the most optimal rate possible. (Slow internet connections can have a detrimental effect on efficiency.)</li><li>Is the software you are using the most appropriate for the type of work you carry out? (Perhaps there is a cheaper option, or one that is more inline with your business service.)</li><li>How long has it been since you upgraded your hardware? (Old items can be significantly slower, and more prone to experiencing issues.)</li><li>Consider your high-level business strategies and work out what it will mean for your IT systems. (It is highly unlikely for any organisation today to be able to achieve strategic goals without the influence/use of technology, so these two aspects need to be aligned.)</li><li>Be open and curious to what is out there, and what other businesses are doing – particularly your competitors. (It can be easy to get stuck in the zone of continuing to do things they way you always have, but change doesn’t need to be a headache – think of it as an exciting opportunity to grow and expand your business.)</li></ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A lot of organisations still only see IT as an expense – a cost to the business that adds no particular value, apart from it being a necessity to function (like power/water etc). But what if you could use IT to increase business profitability?  </p>



<p>So it was seen as an investment and was able to provide efficiencies that allowed the organisation to focus on growing. Who wouldn’t put their hand up for that? So how could it work? </p>



<p>Take these examples; </p>



<h2>6 Ways IT Can Increase Business Profitability</h2>



<h3>1. Virtualisation</h3>



<p>Virtualisation is the creation of a virtual form of something in IT –  from a network to storage, hardware or a server. </p>



<p>So basically this means you can consolidate and run apps on fewer physical servers,  increasing deployment rates and reducing operational costs. It will also provide you with the flexibility of moving and balancing loads depending on requirements  &#8211; something that is highly recommended if you have unpredictable rates of usage, for example, if you are launching a large project which will put a strain on the current operating system. </p>

<h3>2. VoiP and Cloud phone systems</h3>



<p>If you don’t yet use VoiP (voice over IP), you’re missing out on a big opportunity to reduce operating costs. Some estimates have said that the implementation of VoiP in business could save them up to 50 percent of their traditional phone bill. </p>



<p>From phone plans, through to messaging and video conferencing, VoiP and Cloud phone systems aid productivity in the workplace by offering a reliable, unified communication system. </p>



<h3>3. Maximising efficiency</h3>



<p>There is little doubt that being able to use technology to increase efficiency is one of the best ways for a business to see profitable benefits. </p>



<p>Project management systems are a great example of how individuals and teams can collaborate on tasks together but reduce the time required to have ‘catch-up’ meetings, and to update others about what they need to be doing – and of course, this is particularly important for those who don’t work in the same place. </p>



<p>Another software you can look at are collaboration tools such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> that can enable your team to work together efficiently. </p>



<h3>4. Automating tasks</h3>



<p>Think about all the things that occur in your organisation on a daily basis – are there any processes that are carried out over and over by an individual, or even a team?&nbsp; </p>



<p>Now think about if you were able to implement an automated system around that task. For example – remember when paying by credit card meant someone had to take a physical impression of it onto carbon paper? </p>



<p>Today it’s just a simple scan of a machine and the payment is processed, so more transactions can take place faster. </p>



<p>By maximising output, there’s no doubt – due to the economies of scale &#8211; that profits are then able to be increased, as it will take less time for a particular task to be carried out. </p>



<h3>5. Provide first-class service to your customers</h3>



<p>A customer relationship management (CRM) system is a must for any business. And one that has multiple functionalities will allow you to customise your solutions or products to cater for their needs – which obviously results in better customer experience, and repeat business (as well as an increase in referrals). </p>



<p>For example, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.customermonitor.com/blog/how-do-you-calculate-a-net-promoter-score" target="_blank">Net Promoter Score software</a>&nbsp;allows you to capture a wide range of thoughts and feelings from your customers, and take action on those results. </p>



<h3>6. Mobile technology and remote access</h3>



<p>By using technology to make your business <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/modern-workforce/">mobile and remotely accessible</a>, you are making your products and/or services available to a  larger market. However, it is important to realise it’s not just about providing people with mobile phones – as there is a bit more involved than simply being armed with devices. </p>



<p>But once the technology is established, it will open up many new opportunities for your business to grow and increase profits. &#8212;&#8212; This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business? <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/"><strong>Download:&nbsp;An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity</strong></a></p>
