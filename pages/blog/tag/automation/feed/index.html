<p>How do you&nbsp;speed up a process? Automate it. Want to make a process more accurate? More streamlined? Automate it. Want to save time from all your mundane tasks so that you can focus on growing your business? Automation lets you accomplish that.</p>



<p>Automation isn’t just trendy tech anymore,<strong> it’s a necessity if you’re looking to scale your business</strong>. If you don’t start leveraging it now, you simply won’t be able to keep up. In fact, it’s been changing how business for some time now. Here’s how.</p>



<h2>3 Benefits of Business Processes Automation</h2>



<h3>1. Fewer steps</h3>



<p>Automation changes the way you complete business processes.</p>



<p>In other words, when you use an automated system you can dramatically reduce the number of steps it takes to complete a task and the number of people responsible for carrying those steps out.</p>



<p>This drastically improves your organisation&#8217;s overall productivity.</p>



<p>From hiring/recruitment and employee onboarding to accounting and finance, automation solutions help eliminate the repetitive tasks that are prone to human error. For example, in human resources where there&#8217;s so many paperwork and admin tasks, workflow automation can make your HR staff&#8217;s life easier.</p>



<p>A company&#8217;s onboarding process can be automated. Instead of having the new-hire go through generic orientation, an automated series of emails specific to the role can be sent. They&#8217;ll have their own checklist of things to read or do.</p>



<p>Collecting signatures for contract signing can be done within the system too. Email notifications can also be sent to key stakeholders, like peers and the immediate supervisor. IT can also be notified to create email accounts and provide access to certain tools.</p>



<p>Some other areas where automation tools can help HR are leave requests and time sheet approvals. Managing contracts also come into fall under here—supplier/vendor contracts, employee contracts, partnerships, and many more.</p>



<h3>2. Fewer mistakes</h3>



<p>When tasks are automated, or information automatically documented, you reduce the risk for error.</p>



<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the busyness of other tasks and end up making simple mistakes with large repercussions. By streamlining and automating processes, you ensure that those happen less frequently – something your clients are sure to love.</p>



<p>The reason this works is there are often built-in automated controls within the automation system. They follow a certain set of rules that you define beforehand. This means any particular workflow or series of steps will only trigger if certain conditions happen.</p>



<p>Mistakes are expenses. Not only do they cause damage to your reputation, but they are an added cost that reduces your profits. To fix a mistake, you&#8217;ll have to allocate man-hours to do so. And if you add opportunity costs, this presents a bigger problem for business leaders.</p>



<p>Fixing a mistake means you&#8217;ll have to pay their salaries. On top of that, that time spent on rework could have been spent on more value-adding activities.</p>



<h3>3. Less time</h3>



<p>Above all, automation allows you to save time – and what you can then do with that time leaves you with endless opportunities for growing your business.</p>



<p>Think about the amount of mundane and repeatable tasks you complete on a daily basis. When you no longer have to focus your time and energy on those tasks, you can take on larger projects that focus on scale.</p>



<h2>Documentation Automation</h2>



<p>Documentation doesn’t have to be a dreaded time-consuming task. Instead, with automation, a lot of it is done for you.</p>



<p>What’s even better is that we’re not just here to tell you how awesome automation is without offering you the tools to take advantage of it. By creating integrations with your software and CRM, you can automate a ton of your documentation, making your processes not only more efficient but also less time-consuming.</p>

<p>A lot of organisations still only see IT as an expense – a cost to the business that adds no particular value, apart from it being a necessity to function (like power/water etc). But what if you could use IT to increase business profitability?  </p>



<p>So it was seen as an investment and was able to provide efficiencies that allowed the organisation to focus on growing. Who wouldn’t put their hand up for that? So how could it work? </p>



<p>Take these examples; </p>



<h2>6 Ways IT Can Increase Business Profitability</h2>



<h3>1. Virtualisation</h3>



<p>Virtualisation is the creation of a virtual form of something in IT –  from a network to storage, hardware or a server. </p>



<p>So basically this means you can consolidate and run apps on fewer physical servers,  increasing deployment rates and reducing operational costs. It will also provide you with the flexibility of moving and balancing loads depending on requirements  &#8211; something that is highly recommended if you have unpredictable rates of usage, for example, if you are launching a large project which will put a strain on the current operating system. </p>

<h3>2. VoiP and Cloud phone systems</h3>



<p>If you don’t yet use VoiP (voice over IP), you’re missing out on a big opportunity to reduce operating costs. Some estimates have said that the implementation of VoiP in business could save them up to 50 percent of their traditional phone bill. </p>



<p>From phone plans, through to messaging and video conferencing, VoiP and Cloud phone systems aid productivity in the workplace by offering a reliable, unified communication system. </p>



<h3>3. Maximising efficiency</h3>



<p>There is little doubt that being able to use technology to increase efficiency is one of the best ways for a business to see profitable benefits. </p>



<p>Project management systems are a great example of how individuals and teams can collaborate on tasks together but reduce the time required to have ‘catch-up’ meetings, and to update others about what they need to be doing – and of course, this is particularly important for those who don’t work in the same place. </p>



<p>Another software you can look at are collaboration tools such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> that can enable your team to work together efficiently. </p>



<h3>4. Automating tasks</h3>



<p>Think about all the things that occur in your organisation on a daily basis – are there any processes that are carried out over and over by an individual, or even a team?&nbsp; </p>



<p>Now think about if you were able to implement an automated system around that task. For example – remember when paying by credit card meant someone had to take a physical impression of it onto carbon paper? </p>



<p>Today it’s just a simple scan of a machine and the payment is processed, so more transactions can take place faster. </p>



<p>By maximising output, there’s no doubt – due to the economies of scale &#8211; that profits are then able to be increased, as it will take less time for a particular task to be carried out. </p>



<h3>5. Provide first-class service to your customers</h3>



<p>A customer relationship management (CRM) system is a must for any business. And one that has multiple functionalities will allow you to customise your solutions or products to cater for their needs – which obviously results in better customer experience, and repeat business (as well as an increase in referrals). </p>



<p>For example, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.customermonitor.com/blog/how-do-you-calculate-a-net-promoter-score" target="_blank">Net Promoter Score software</a>&nbsp;allows you to capture a wide range of thoughts and feelings from your customers, and take action on those results. </p>



<h3>6. Mobile technology and remote access</h3>



<p>By using technology to make your business <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/modern-workforce/">mobile and remotely accessible</a>, you are making your products and/or services available to a  larger market. However, it is important to realise it’s not just about providing people with mobile phones – as there is a bit more involved than simply being armed with devices. </p>



<p>But once the technology is established, it will open up many new opportunities for your business to grow and increase profits. &#8212;&#8212; This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business? <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/"><strong>Download:&nbsp;An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity</strong></a></p>
