<p><span id="alttext-container"><span id="alttext">Is IT in your business set up to be risk free?&nbsp;</span></span>Do you have a risk management process set up? If no, this is something that requires your urgent attention. If you do are you sure it is fool-proof?</p>



<p>To capture the subject in its entirety, ISACA describes risk management for IT as “the process of identifying vulnerabilities and threats to the information resources used by an organization in achieving business objectives, and deciding what countermeasures, if any, to take in reducing risk to an acceptable level, based on the value of the information resource to the organization.”</p>



<p><strong>This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business? Download:&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/">An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity</a></strong></p>



<p>Here’s how to set up a process for IT risk management (ITRM).</p>



<h2>6 Questions to Ask When Setting Up IT Risk Management</h2>



<h3>1. Who</h3>



<p>Who is going to implement the ITRM strategy? Who is going to action it when/if it is required? These need to be clearly set out in order for all personnel to understand what they have responsibility for – and this will ensure the procedures set out are effectively actioned when required.</p>



<p>There also needs to be the appropriate level of authorisation given to those in charge of risk management, so they are able to carry out decision-making for situations where there isn’t a defined path for resolution.</p>



<h3>2. What</h3>



<p>What are the risks you face as an organisation? Think about all possible internal and external threats, and then set guidelines around what level of risk they pose to your business – as well as tolerance benchmarks to identify what course of action to take to rectify the issue&nbsp;that has occurred.</p>



<h3>3. Where</h3>



<p>Every business and organisation needs to have a plan for ITRM, and it needs to be kept visible for all of those involved in its development and implementation. It is important to have alignment throughout the company, and for the ITRM to be worked alongside with other business policies and procedures.</p>



<h3>4. When</h3>



<p>Timings are critical for risk management response – so set up deadlines for when identified courses of action should be taken. And again, this can be separated out into each level of risk – to determine when a resolution should take effect, or when it needs to be escalated to a higher authority.</p>



<h3>5. Why</h3>



<p>As well as knowing what IT risks you f ace as a business, you should also be able to understand why they are an issue for your organisation. This can help with putting processes in place as to your course of action following risk infiltration.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, ‘Why would it matter that our data was compromised?’ Because it would mean private details of customers would be exposed.</p>



<h3>6. How</h3>



<p>So following on from the above, how do you mitigate that risk? Whether it is by enhancing security, or putting other protection processes in place.</p>

<p>Computer technology is ever-evolving. From storing information on personal computers, servers and the web, the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cloud-solutions/">cloud</a> marks the latest technological milestone.</p>



<p class="p1">Businesses can host and share secure documents through cloud-based online storage while expanding their ability to cost-effectively meet computing resource demands.</p>



<h2 class="p2">Top 5 Benefits of the Cloud</h2>



<h3 class="p2">1. Cost-effective</h3>



<p class="p2">Using the cloud you pay only for the computing resources you use, rather than pre‐purchasing space and server equipment you may not need.</p>



<p class="p2">Eliminating the use of servers, in turn, reduces the need for storage space.</p>



<div class="toc">

<h3 class="p2">2. Speed of Access</h3>



<p class="p2">The speed of some servers and internal systems slows down the further you are away from them, which isn’t great if you need files on the go. </p>



<p class="p2">Distance isn’t an issue with cloud storage. The faster you get your hands on the information, the more efficiently your business runs.</p>



<h3 class="p2">3. Flexibility of space needed</h3>



<p class="p2">Business’ workloads can scale up or down regularly, and the cloud’s capacity can adapt with you without the hassle of extra equipment.</p>



<h3 class="p2">4. Easy IT Management</h3>



<p class="p2">By taking out the manpower needed to run a complex internal IT function and replacing it with a user-friendly platform, business owners can focus on key goals. The cloud service offers a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/7-advantages-of-cloud-computing/">standardised platform</a> that allows for easy upgrades when needed.</p>



<h3 class="p2">5. Environmentally Friendly</h3>



<p class="p2">A paperless cloud system uses fewer resources than a server-centric system. Your carbon footprint is smaller and more environmentally friendly.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>It’s important to be forward thinking and to take us into the  21st century. Good systems, less paper, less files and folders is part  of that.</strong></p><cite>Grace Ikiua, CEO, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud/">Good Seed Trust</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="p2">Risks of Using the Cloud</h2>



<p class="p1">Cloud systems are <strong>not immune</strong> from data leaks or cyber attacks, but neither are servers or network storage. It’s estimated cyber crime costs businesses $400 billion worldwide, not to mention the lost earnings that come from virus attacks, lost data and crashed systems.</p>



<p class="p1">Unfortunately, the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/which-employees-are-your-biggest-security-risk/">biggest security risk</a> to your business comes from within, especially the <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/">top leaders in your organisation</a>. </p>



<p class="p1">All it takes to get inside your network is a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">weak password</a> or an <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">employee innocently clicking on a line on an email</a>.</p>



<h4 class="p2"><strong>Before moving to the cloud, it is important that you:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Assess all risks, create an inventory, and determine the potential outcome to your business</li><li>Determine the likelihood of these risks occurring and the residual risk it may have on your clientele.</li><li><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: inherit;">Consider your likely responses to these risks and create a plan of action.</span></li></ul>



<p class="p2">Your plan of action has to include both the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">technical and human elements</a>.</p>



<p class="p2">One technical solution is choosing infrastructures that incorporate security &#8211; rather than trying to add it to an existing legacy system. Often organisations focus on “making the walls higher.”</p>



<p class="p2">These “higher walls” could include numbers of firewalls — which in turn will result in an increase in log files and alerts. None of this guaranteed to prevent attacks ‐ especially if the danger is let in.</p>



<p class="p2">This is why it’s important to train your staff to understand threats and keep up with the latest cyber attack methods.</p>



<p class="p2">It takes technology, processes and people working together to protect your cloud storage system and effectively counter cyber threats.</p>
