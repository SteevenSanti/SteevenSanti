<p>Let’s face it. Today’s technological advancements have made even the simplest things complicated. The simple act of communication in the workplace has become so complex that it causes inefficiencies and productivity issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Watch this quick video about the reality of this situation…</p>



<iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6607911793664884736?compact=1" allowfullscreen="" title="Embedded post" width="504" height="284" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>



<p>These numerous options give us the freedom to choose whichever platform we want. And while that may seem like a great thing, having too many options often paralyzes us.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Paradox of Choice</h2>



<p>Psychologist Barry Schwartz explained this phenomenon during one of his TED talks. You can watch the entire video below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice" allowfullscreen="" width="854" height="480"></iframe></figure><br>



<p>In the video, he shared about the paradox of choice. </p>



<p>Here&#8217;s one of my favorites. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all. </p><cite>Barry Schwartz, TEDGlobal 2005</cite></blockquote>



<h3>What This Means for Your Business</h3>



<p>Having too many options can be detrimental to your business because it leaves people paralyzed. It makes them inefficient. And that’s certainly not what you want as leaders in your organisation. </p>



<p>You want your people productive. You want them effective. You want them to be able to do their jobs properly. </p>



<p>How many times have you tried searching for a conversation thread that you swore was on your email, but only found out later the it was sent through Skype?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or when was the last time you tried searching for a report only to find out you have four different “final” copies sitting on your computer? One in your desktop, another in your downloads folder, another in Google Drive, and the other one in Dropbox. </p>



<p>Too many choices is often a recipe for disaster. Barry Schwartz said it best.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large"><p>There’s no question that some choice is better than none. But it doesn’t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice.  </p><cite>Barry Schwartz</cite></blockquote>



<p>So, give your staff and your entire organisation a gift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pick one or two communication channels (or storage, or whatever you need) and only use that. Roll it out to your entire organisation. Include the introduction and training of the tools in your onboarding program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We recommend&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>&nbsp;because you can do all those things — communicate, collaborate, make a call, video conference, store files, work on those files, and many more — inside one app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More and more business, big and small, are starting to realise the traditional collaborating of calls and emails are no longer productive. Enterprise-grade collaboration <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2471537/beyond-cool--the-cold--hard-facts-on-collaboration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requires much more</a> than basic tools could offer. Companies and teams are turning to the latest alternative &#8211; collaboration software. </p>



<p>You may have clicked on this article because you are not sure of how collaboration tools could help your business. Here are the seven reasons to use collaboration tools in your business: </p>



<h2>Top 7 Reasons Your Business Should Have a Collaboration Software</h2>



<h3>1. Time effectiveness </h3>



<p>In business, time is gold, and you want to spend your precious time being productive. Waiting for other people to reply or share – could consume your whole day. The purpose of using a collaboration tool is, in the end, is to stop your business from wasting time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Information efficiency </h3>



<p>Email – the traditional way of collaborating. You attached the newest version of the document. Send it to the intended recipients and wait for their response. The thing is&#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sharing files by email is a painful process for both senders and receivers &#8211; especially when you have many people contributing to the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, it can get messy &#8211; overwhelmingly messy!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is overwhelming when there are many version of files, coming from different people at the same time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top collaboration tools would have many modifications, add-ons, bots that allows users to edit the project in sync. Upload your document and assign colleagues or teams to different chapters. They can then work together in real-time to get the content exactly how you want it. For total transparency, you can then use the audit trail to see what changes made and by whom.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. They offer more choice than written material </h3>



<p>In the digital world, it can be challenging to convey your exact purpose and thoughts by writing. An ideal collaboration tool would allow users to send messages, voice messages, screen sharing and send all types of files.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1001" height="225" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DS_Files-Send.png" alt="multiple options for communication" class="wp-image-5914" title="Collaboration Software - 7 Reasons to Have One for Your Business 1"></figure>



<p>A collaboration tool can minimise the number of gadgets you ‘need’ to use, by having them all in one place. Reducing your long list of daily software to three or even less! Just one login and they&#8217;re all at your fingertips. You won&#8217;t need to remember the gazillions of passwords. Wouldn’t that be better?</p>



<h3>4. Makes your project more organised </h3>



<p>How many times did you turn your inbox upside down to find an email? From data, meeting times, and internal communication, the amount of information we need to keep track of&nbsp;is vast.</p>



<p>Sometimes it isn’t about personality, you just haven’t use the right tool yet. Being organised is a competitive advantage, and no company should take it for granted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="1024" height="344" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DS_Files-Section-1024x344.png" alt="Files and documents in one place" class="wp-image-5916" title="Collaboration Software - 7 Reasons to Have One for Your Business 2"></figure>



<p>Once you logged in, conference call facilities, calendars, and tasks management allow you to carry out your meeting. You can even send meeting reminders or reminders of all sorts to everyone. Isn’t it much better than sending emails, and hoping people would remember?</p>



<h3>5. Security </h3>



<p>Security is especially important when you’re handling the sensitive part of the project. Thinking about the serve consequences of data breach may already be giving you shivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emails can be vulnerable to data breaches, however, a collaboration tool will give you absolute control over your data. You will decide who has the permission to access it and for how long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>6. Reduce stress </h3>



<p>Managing a project is never easy and unnecessary clutters don’t help. That’s why organisations need collaboration tools. To relieve managers from unproductive complexity, simply by facilitating communication and empower accountability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collaboration tools allow you to see everyone&#8217;s work, and them being able to see yours. The exchange of information, ideas and comments becomes easier and faster. Being able to see progress will likely reduce your stress, and it can lift your team spirit too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>7. Staying on budget </h3>



<p>Staying on budget is a common goal for all managers. The capability to track history and progress would help managers divide resources better. Most collaboration software would allow managers to be on top of all the milestones, process, status and the content of each project.  </p>



<p>Other surprising peaks are travel costs saving. Whether it is domestic or international travel, it can be expensive, especially for extended periods&nbsp;of time. That’s why collaboration software is the solution. You can work at any time or location. </p>



<p>Do you think collaboration tool is needed in your organisation? If you do,</p>
