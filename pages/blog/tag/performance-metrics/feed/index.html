<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-must-measure-it-productivity-in-your-business/">Fast, streamlined and efficient IT systems</a> underpin most successful, modern businesses. As a result, your IT provider often feels less like an external agency, and more like part of your team.</p>



<p>Chances are you speak to them multiple times a week, if not a day! Therefore it makes sense to put processes in place to manage and nurture this key professional relationship.</p>



<p>It is good business practice to set KPIs you can both agree on, ensuring that expectations are met on both sides. This way, you can measure which processes work well and which ones require some adjustment. As the old saying goes, “if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it”.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-recognise-its-time-for-your-business-to-outsource-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to recognise it&#8217;s time for your business to outsource IT&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Setting KPIs will help you work together as a team to tackle IT challenges as they arise. It will also go a long way to minimise the risk of confusion or conflict. Problems will be solved swiftly and professionally, creating a harmonious work environment for all involved.</p>



<p>Every business is different, so the KPIs you choose will likely be unique to your requirements and objectives. However, below are three common KPIs which apply to most industries and business types. These are a good place to start.</p>



<p>And if you already have an existing IT provider, you can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-to-expect-from-outsourced-it-are-you-getting-bang-for-your-buck/">perform an audit</a> by following these steps.</p>



<h2>3 KPIs You Should Set With Your IT Provider</h2>



<h3>1. Response time and communication</h3>



<p>This is a great KPI as it’s an opportunity for you and your IT provider to set some ground rules for general communication. Together, agree on reasonable response times, so you’ll know how long it will take to receive a reply to requests. This will save you calling every five minutes for an update (which is time-consuming for both parties), and ensure you have realistic expectations.</p>



<p>You might want to set several ‘response time categories’. For example, urgent requests may require a 5-hour response time, while non-urgent requests may be handled within two days.</p>



<p>While on the topic of communication, you should also check with your IT provider as to the best way to contact them when there’s a problem. For example, do they prefer a phone call, an email or that you lodge a ticket via a software system?</p>



<p>By acknowledging their preferred method of communication, you are more likely to get prompt, efficient service.</p>



<h3>2. Average time spent from initial request to final resolution</h3>



<p>This KPI measures the average length of time it takes for your IT provider to resolve your requests. As your requests will most likely vary widely, you will probably need to measure this KPI for several months before you can establish a fair, accurate turnaround time to aim towards.</p>



<p>This is also a good opportunity to agree on how your IT provider should inform you about the resolution process. For example, you could request a time estimate at the outset of every project, or perhaps agree to speak on the phone once a week to monitor progress. Again, it’s all about <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/8-questions-to-ask-when-choosing-a-new-it-provider/">managing expectations and keeping the lines of communication open</a>.</p>



<h3>3. Error rate and/or security incidents</h3>



<p>No IT provider is perfect, and every now and then mistakes do occur. When you’re setting KPIs, discuss the likelihood of errors, security incidents and other slip-ups so you know what to expect. If mistakes do occur, put processes in place to handle these in an effective, professional manner.</p>



<p>By discussing possible ‘worst-case-scenarios’ ahead of time, it means you will be prepared in the event something does go wrong – even if the chances of this happening are slim.</p>



<h3><strong>Remember: Put KPIs in Writing</strong></h3>



<p>Don’t forget to formalise these KPIs by putting them in writing and having all involved parties sign. When you sign a contract with an IT company, you should receive a <strong>service level agreement</strong> (SLA) which outlines the work they will be providing; this is a good place to add the KPIs.</p>

<p>Technology is no longer a stand-alone function within a business – well, it shouldn’t be. That is because for most organisations today, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-it-issues-are-reducing-your-businesss-productivity/">IT productivity</a> has a direct correlation with profit, and output efficiency.</p>



<p>So for a business owner or General Manager to not have an understanding of how technology affects the overall proficiency of their organisation, there is a very real risk that tasks and processes won’t be undertaken at the maximum level possible.</p>



<p>One of the first things to work out for your organisation is <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/">what productivity actually means</a> to your business. How do you measure it and what goals/KPIs do you have around the output of your team?</p>



<p>Once you know the end outcome, then you can work backwards to understand the process of throughput – i.e. the stages that are undertaken to complete the end product or service.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/stop-making-these-5-it-mistakes-in-your-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stop making these 5 IT mistakes in your business</a></p>



<p>These step-by-step actions should then provide a more detailed knowledge around how technology is involved in the working method. And once you know where IT fits in, you can then <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/business-technology-you-should-be-implementing/">directly correlate</a> it to where the technology works well, and where it lacks efficiency – enabling you to get a firm insight into how the IT systems affect productivity in your business.</p>



<p>From here there will then be options to streamline processes, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/automation-is-changing-everything/">introduce automation</a> (or further automate functionalities) and limit any areas where technology might be having a negative impact on productivity – for example if your business computers take 2 minutes to load in the morning, and you have 50 staff, then that is more than an hour of lost time in one working day.</p>



<p>After completing these activities (which could take a little while) it is then important to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/">consider ROI</a> of any investments you do decide to make into IT. Of course this can even be done before you make a decision on what to implement by estimating how it will impact on the output by calculating the increase in productivity.</p>



<p>Want to brainstorm some ways your business might be able to benefit from better IT systems? Consider the following:</p>



<ol><li>Investigate your ISP/internet speed and check it is running at the most optimal rate possible. (Slow internet connections can have a detrimental effect on efficiency.)</li><li>Is the software you are using the most appropriate for the type of work you carry out? (Perhaps there is a cheaper option, or one that is more inline with your business service.)</li><li>How long has it been since you upgraded your hardware? (Old items can be significantly slower, and more prone to experiencing issues.)</li><li>Consider your high-level business strategies and work out what it will mean for your IT systems. (It is highly unlikely for any organisation today to be able to achieve strategic goals without the influence/use of technology, so these two aspects need to be aligned.)</li><li>Be open and curious to what is out there, and what other businesses are doing – particularly your competitors. (It can be easy to get stuck in the zone of continuing to do things they way you always have, but change doesn’t need to be a headache – think of it as an exciting opportunity to grow and expand your business.)</li></ol>
