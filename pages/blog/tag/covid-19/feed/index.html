<p>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting businesses of all sizes. With <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28 confirmed cases</a> in New Zealand as of 19 March, the government has stepped in to protect Kiwis both in the private and public sector. </p>



<p>Because of this, businesses are being forced to adopt flexible work arrangements to protect their staff, customers, and partners. That means implementing <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/remote-work/">remote work or working from home</a>. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, most Kiwi businesses aren&#8217;t prepared for this. That&#8217;s why we put together several free resources to help you cope in this situation. </p>



<h2>Free Microsoft Teams and Remote Work Training Webinars</h2>



<p>Communication and collaboration is key to situations like this. </p>



<p>One of the tools that can help with this is <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>. It&#8217;s a tool that we also use internally that allows everybody in the organisation to chat, call, and collaborate in one app. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about MS Teams, we&#8217;re conducting a series of free webinar training next week. Below is a list of the schedule:</p>



<ul><li>Monday, 23 March, 12:30 PM — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_WVWEyBc6Sbm27XGI9Oq8Yw" target="_blank">Reserve Your Spot</a></li><li>Wednesday, 25 March, 1:00 PM — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Reserve Your Spot (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_G2xkj4HYRqyptc8POBfYcA" target="_blank">Reserve Your Spot</a></li><li>Thursday, 26 March, 10:00 AM — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Reserve Your Spot (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_uTp9dZHGSBOx3YRTcaAGXw" target="_blank">Reserve Your Spot</a></li><li>Monday, 30 March (Registration link to follow)</li><li>Wednesday, 1 April (Registration link to follow) </li></ul>



<h2>Curated Resources for Remote Work</h2>



<p>Implementing work from home setups can be challenging, especially if this is new for you. That&#8217;s why we put together a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/remote-work/">resource page for remote work</a> that you can use. We&#8217;ll be adding more in the future. </p>



<p>We looked at the situation from four different perspectives. </p>



<ol><li>CEO / Business Owner</li><li>CIO / IT Managers</li><li>Managers </li><li>Individual Contributors</li></ol>



<p>So, whether you are worried about your culture suffering, or the security of company data, or about your own productivity, we&#8217;ve got something for you. </p>



<h2>Remote Work Self Assessment Grader</h2>



<p>We also released a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/covid-19-remote-work-readiness-assessment/">grader/self-assessment tool</a> that gives you a score on whether you are ready to implement remote work or which areas you need to address first. </p>



<ul><li>Just answer 10 questions</li><li>It takes 2-3 minutes</li><li>Automatically emails you a report</li></ul>



<p>Do you think we missed any? Is there any topic you&#8217;d like to cover? <strong><em>Do let us know in the comments below</em></strong>.</p>
