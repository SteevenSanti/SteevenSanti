<p>Think you’re protected from <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> threats because you’ve got firewalls and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-signs-you-probably-need-new-antivirus-software-security/">antivirus software</a>? Think again. </p>



<p>You must secure your wireless network, too. <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">Staying safe in the digital age</a>&nbsp;is extremely challenging because there are so many ‘gaps’ or ‘windows’ that hackers can jump through. How to secure your wireless network &#8211; and&nbsp;protect yourself and your business – simply comes down to finding ways to seal all of these gaps  as efficiently as possible. </p>



<h2>Keeping hackers out is a like trying to keep a New Zealand home warm in winter</h2>



<p>Kiwi houses are notoriously difficult to heat due to a lack of  insulation, double-glazed windows, or adequate ventilation systems. If you live in a cold, damp house, the challenge is to identify all the  areas where heat is escaping and fix them accordingly. For example, you might need to take the following actions: </p>



<ul><li>install insulation in the ceiling, walls and beneath the floorboards;</li><li>seal any gaps in the framework, including around windows and under doors;</li><li>invest in a heating or ventilation system, such as HRV or a heat pump;</li><li>put up thermal-lined curtains to keep the warmth in at night; or</li><li>retrofit your home with double-glazed windows.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, doing one of these things isn’t enough in isolation. If you buy a heat pump but fail to seal your windows or install insulation without curtains, then the heat will simply escape through other gaps.  </p>



<p>While you may not be able to afford to do everything on the list, you should <strong>combine as many actions as you can</strong> for maximum energy efficiency. The same mentality can be applied to&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;(although it’s important to keep in mind that the consequences of a hacked network tend to be more problematic than those of a cold house).  </p>



<p>Consequences aside, the point is – you need to take a collaborative approach to cyber security. <strong>There’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution</strong>. Seal as many gaps as you can. </p>



<h2><strong>One gap that many businesses overlook is their wireless network</strong></h2>



<p>An unsecured wireless network is vulnerable to hackers, malware, and  other suspicious activity. </p>



<p>To quote&nbsp;WatchGuard,&nbsp;“Today’s network threats aren’t tethered to the desktop. Your security can’t be, either.” </p>



<p>According to WatchGuard’s director of product management, Ryan Orsi, wireless threats are becoming more frequent and problematic due to the availability of public wifi networks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Organisations across all industries are facing increased 
pressure from customers, vendors, and employees to offer wireless 
access. Unfortunately, hackers are also constantly trying to gain a 
foothold into the network,”</p></blockquote>



<p>Ryan Orsi goes on to&nbsp;recommend that all organisations implement improved security, in particular on wifi networks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Businesses that fail to properly secure their wifi 
networks, including guest hotspots, may expose customers, partners, and 
internal users to a variety of risks.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Exposing such threats could be extremely damaging to your reputation as a  business and cause your customers to look elsewhere. When viewed in this light, wireless security is as much about protecting your reputation – and giving your customers peace of mind – as it is about protecting your security.</p>



<p>WatchGuard offers a number of products and features to secure <strong>your wifi networks, such as the WatchGuard Firebox T30 and T50, the WatchGuard Firebox T10, and WatchGuard Access Points.
