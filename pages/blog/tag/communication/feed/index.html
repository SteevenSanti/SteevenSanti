										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Quick question — do you love email?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re like most people, you probably don’t. But, it’s a necessary evil. It’s still the most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preferred medium of communication in business</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But did you know that email was invented in the 1970s? It’s almost 50 years since then. The way we use it has remained relatively the same — send one message to another, wait for their reply, read that reply some time in the future, and back all over again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, the work we do today has evolved a lot. It requires faster communication and frequent collaboration. That’s why relying on email isn’t enough.&nbsp;That&#8217;s why tools like <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> are being used by thousands of businesses around the world to transform their business. </p>



<h2>4 Reasons Why Email Is Not Enough</h2>



<p>Adobe conducted a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adobe/2019-adobe-email-usage-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Email Study</a> last year. One of the biggest takeaways in that study is that we spend a lot of time sending emails and following up on the emails we just sent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phrases like…</p>



<ul><li>now sure if you saw my last email, or</li><li>per my last email, or&nbsp;</li><li>any updates on this, or&nbsp;</li><li>as discussed&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>…were at the top of the list of the most annoying phrases people use at work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you have most likely experienced, email is easy to ignore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, with multiple people and organizations constantly spamming our email accounts, it makes it difficult to focus on the important ones in our inbox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’re like most people, you probably have multiple email accounts and receive hundreds of emails a day. This adds another layer of complexity and opens up a lot of other issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you want to get ahead, there has got to be a better way, right?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Today’s Work Requires More Collaboration and Communication</h3>



<p>The first reason why email is not enough is today’s work requires more collaboration and frequent communication with other people. More often than not, your work, including the work your entire organization does, rely on other people’s input.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine two businesses with the exact same resources, selling the exact same products. The only difference is the brand/company name. They are both in the same starting position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Company A decided to adapt a modern approach to work — i.e. to use technology to communicate with each other faster and collaborate easier; while Company B remains status quo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who do you think will get ahead in 3-, 6-, 12- months’ time? Who do you think can launch faster and better products? Which one will be able to resolve new issues that come up during the course of business?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Short One-Off Questions in Emails Are Prevalent</h3>



<p>According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, the average employee&nbsp;<a href="https://fsd.servicemax.com/2018/01/09/8-reasons-email-is-ineffective-in-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spends 13 hours a week</a>&nbsp;checking, reading, and responding to email. That’s over 30% of the entire work week.&nbsp;In the Adobe study, this number was 17 hours per week — or roughly 42% of the work week. </p>



<p>Email isn’t meant for real-time communication and collaboration. If you emailed your boss asking a clarifying question and she doesn’t get back to until after 2 days, you’ve already lost those 2 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this can extend to your colleagues and teammates, suppliers and vendors, and even customers. Imagine how much time you will lose if that person doesn’t reply to your email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, think about the effect to these delays to your organisation? Product launches? Extended R&amp;Ds? Growing number of irritated customers?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Email Makes Remote Work Difficult </h3>



<p>Third, with the advent of technology, specifically the internet, it allowed for people to be <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/modern-workforce/">more mobile</a>. The internet gave people and companies the ability to work from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a team member might be working at a nearby cafe and get a lot more work done than being in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike before the rise of the internet and technology, most work were tangible. You literally see, feel, count, and assess them. For example, a shoemaker produces shoes. A car manufacturer produces cars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But today, a programmer can write code for months or years before the something tangible comes out of it (e.g. the new iOS 13 of Apple, or a new game).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why frequent communication is essential in today’s competitive environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. You Limit Yourself With Local Talent </h3>



<p>One of the trends in the workplace right now is companies can take advantage of globalization. Organisations are no longer limited by the talent they find locally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With technology, you can tap the best talent you can find and work with them even if they are halfway across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re only using email, this will make it difficult for you to take advantage of their skills and talent. As mentioned earlier, frequent communication and constant collaboration is the hallmark of the today’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the team member who is halfway around the world doesn’t get the chance to mingle and develop a good working relationship with the others, that remote member will most likely leave in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>Microsoft dominates 72% of all desktop and laptop computers in the world with their operating system — Windows. And if you’re using Windows, you are most likely be using <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/empower-your-business-with-office-365/">Microsoft Office</a> suites — like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means you are most likely paying (or paid) for MS Teams already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you’re paying for it already, and you know that it will make your communications better, why not make use of it? And if not, MS Teams has a free version that you can take advantage of in your organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world is constantly evolving. That means if you want to thrive, you also have to adapt to these changes. And that means providing your organisation with tools to make them more productive. It means enabling them so they can spend less time worrying about internal issues, and instead focus on what really matters — your customers.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the signs your organisation has kept up with the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">digital age</a>&nbsp;is the use of a&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/top-collaboration-software-for-new-zealand-businesses/">collaboration tool or software</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have you ever experienced any of these scenarios?&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Sent numerous emails but don’t get replies</li><li>Can’t seem to find the conversation you had with a customer or colleague</li><li>Misunderstood each other from an email (or SMS) because of the lack of context&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Now, think about the repercussions of these things in your business. If you can’t get a&nbsp;<em>timely</em>&nbsp;reply from your boss, colleague, or supplier, it would cause delays in any projects you are working on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that’s related to a product launch, that would mean you’d be incurring additional expenses&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;losing potential revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if you could avoid all these issues/scenarios and instead focus on working collaboratively with your team?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, you will learn how you can use&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>&nbsp;to overcome these kinds of issue, and take advantage of it so you can adapt to changes in the market faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft Teams is an app that allows you to communicate with your teammates anytime and anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, it allows your organization to chat or message one another. But it goes beyond that. It also features calls, video conferencing, and screen sharing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4 Reasons to Implement MS Teams&nbsp;</h2>



<p>MS Teams meets all the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-microsoft-teams/">criteria you need for choosing a collaboration software</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, it’s a&nbsp;<strong>multi-platform app</strong>. Whether you’re using a Mac or Windows, on-the-go on your mobile phone, or in the office, you can take MS Teams along with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, it’s&nbsp;<strong>built with privacy and security</strong>&nbsp;in mind. Everything is encrypted automatically, so you don’t have to worry about privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For business owners and IT administrators,&nbsp;<strong>user level access</strong>&nbsp;is simple and easy to do. You can easily create accounts for each member of the team, and even add guests or outsiders like your customers, partners, or other contractors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, if you’re already using Microsoft products, then you’re most likely paying for MS Teams already. That means you&nbsp;<strong>don’t have to pay</strong>for anything additional to increase your organization’s productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How to Use Microsoft Teams: 3 Key Capabilities You Need to Know</h2>



<p>In the previous article, we mentioned that the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/build-strong-foundation/">success of any change initiative</a>&nbsp;lies in the commitment of leadership, gaining inputs from key stakeholders, and focusing on the future instead of the now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We won’t go into the technical details of how to implement MS Teams, rather, below are 3 key capabilities you need to know.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. The Right Message for the Right Time (Context) </h3>



<p>In MS Teams, you can chat/message an individual or a group of people. You can also call, leave a voice message, or have a video meeting with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just think of the last time you read an email and thought your colleague was being rude to you only to find out later that he was just making a joke.&nbsp;<strong>Context is often lost</strong>&nbsp;in written communication, like email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or just think of the last time you were emailing back-and-forth with a colleague only to find out later that you were talking about two different projects?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the best form of communication is still face-to-face, sometimes, that is impossible because of the nature of our work. Sometimes, our work requires us to travel or work with remote teammates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you were to hop on a call together, that misunderstanding could have been avoided. In just a few clicks, you can do all of them inside MS Teams.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Recordings and Screen Sharing</h3>



<p>Meetings are a fact of organizational life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a professional, you meet with your boss, your peers, your subordinates (or staff). Outside the organisation, you meet with customers, partners and vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we rely on more people to get our own work done, it’s imperative that we work smarter and avoid/reduce misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS Teams allows you to use a different medium to communicate more effectively. You can use chat/messaging, calls, or leave voice notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See related:&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-teams-vs-skype-for-business/">Microsoft Teams vs Skype for Business</a></p>



<p>But one of the most-used feature of Teams is the ability to do video calls. It’s the&nbsp;<em>modern&nbsp;</em>way of meeting where it looks and feels like you are meeting face-to-face. During the call, you can also share your screen as if you were presenting in front of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also record the call so that you can later go back to it, or if someone was late or couldn’t make it, they can review and watch the meeting itself. There’s no more need to spend time catching up your colleague.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Integrations</h3>



<p>MS Teams also allow you to work together with your team more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams allow you to add integrations like embedding an Excel spreadsheet directly so you or anyone else who needs to update or view it can do so without opening Excel or leaving the Teams app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For channels dedicated to certain projects, you can add all the notes in one place (wiki). This can include a brief background on the project plus decisions made over time. This benefits everyone because the notes only exist in one place, guaranteeing that it’s the most up-to-date version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a project management software that you’re using, like Asana, you can also add your projects directly. This way, everyone can stay on the same page and can add/update/modify/know the status in real time.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With security threats evolving at a rapid place, organisations must regularly communicate with their employees about potential risks, and educate them about cyber security best practices.</p>



<p>Whether they mean to or not, employees pose a huge threat to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a>. According to <a href="https://media.scmagazine.com/documents/82/ibm_cyber_security_intelligenc_20450.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by IBM</a>, an astounding <strong>95% of cyber security incidents</strong> can be traced back to human error. An organisation’s best line of defence is to address this ‘human factor’, rather than to rely solely on technology to safeguard against hackers.</p>



<p>WIth that in mind here are five ways to keep the lines of communication open.</p>



<h2>5 Ways to Communicate Cyber Security to Employees</h2>



<h3>1. Send regular cyber security updates (via email)</h3>



<p>Ensure security is at the forefront of your employee’s minds by sending cyber security emails on a regular basis. Try to make these interesting and informative, with <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">practical tips</a> for staying secure. If possible, these emails should be informed by your IT department, but written by your marketing team (to ensure they are clear, concise and easy-to-read).</p>



<p>Another tip is to send these emails at the same time every week, month or quarter. This way, your employees will know when to expect them (and hopefully set some time aside in their schedule to bring themselves up to speed).</p>



<p>Have team leaders quiz staff about the contents of each email, to make sure everyone is reading them, not just moving them to the trash folder.</p>



<h3>2. Create cyber security KPIs</h3>



<p>Incorporate cyber security into employee performance reviews. Staff will likely be more motivated to abide by cyber security rules if they know it will have a direct impact on their performance.</p>



<p>This strategy is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/put-cybersecurity-on-staff-kpis-former-cia-tech-boss-418358" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly supported by former CIA chief technology officer Bob Flores</a>. Speaking at an IT event in Melbourne earlier this year, he said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Everyone in the company should have, as part of their performance evaluation, how they treat security. Employees have to be educated about security, and they have to be educated again and again and again. You can’t do it once as they come into the organisation, they have to learn about it until they retire.”</p><cite>Bob Flores, former CIA CTO</cite></blockquote>



<p>Some examples of cyber security KPIs include the number of websites blocked, percentage of virus incidents, and the percentage of spam emails detected.</p>



<h3>3. Hold regular training sessions</h3>



<p>Run regular workshops about <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">cyber security in the workplace</a>. These could be facilitated by your IT department, or in smaller companies, by an external IT agency. Whether you have the budget for a 1-hour presentation or a 1-day interactive workshop, every effort counts.</p>



<p>The aim is to keep cyber security top-of-mind for all your employees and to foster a culture of being informed and well-educated. Investing in training sessions is a way to show your employees that cyber security is more than just ‘talk’; that it’s a top priority within your organisation.</p>



<h3>4. Encourage questions and feedback</h3>



<p>There is a lot of fear surrounding cyber security, but try your best not to let this permeate your organisation. While your employees should take cyber security seriously, if they are too scared to ask questions this could cause them to make more mistakes.</p>



<p>Cyber security is a challenging topic, and many people may find it tough to get their head around. Encourage people to ask questions and submit feedback. You could even create a system where people can submit anonymous enquiries. Try to develop a culture based on trust and communication as opposed to fear.</p>



<h3>5. Make cyber security information impossible to ignore</h3>



<p>When it comes to protecting your organisation from security threats, <strong>there’s no such thing as too much communication</strong>. Place visual reminders about important cyber security practices throughout the office. Add cyber security to meeting agendas on a monthly or quarterly basis. Randomly quiz employees about their knowledge to make sure the message is getting through.</p>



<p>Although this might sound tedious, it will help you create a culture that takes cyber security seriously; and the cost savings of this can be enormous.</p>

<p>If you’re not technologically-savvy, the thought of communicating with an IT expert might fill you with dread. It’s a well-known stereotype that many IT professionals seem to speak a language of their own – usually something that sounds like English, only it’s peppered with programme-specific jargon and fancy-sounding acronyms.</p>



<p>Unless you speak ‘tech’, you probably don’t enjoy it when such IT types aren’t able to provide you with information that’s easy to understand. This is why it’s essential to work with an IT company which prides itself on having excellent communication skills.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-should-set-kpis-for-your-it-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why you should set KPIs for your IT company</a></p>



<p>Ideally, your IT company will be able to educate you about all of the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-keep-up-to-date-with-technological-changes-affecting-a-business/">new technologies</a> you’re looking to implement in your business, so you can make well-informed decisions. They’ll act as an advisor and guide you in the right direction, but they’ll also make sure you understand exactly what’s going on each step of the way – after all, it’s your business!</p>



<p>Although it may seem easier to ‘just let the IT guys do their thing’, it’s important to have a strong understanding of why you’re <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">investing in certain technologies</a>, as this will enable you to be a better leader.</p>



<p>Speaking of leadership, not every IT professional will understand the importance of good communication from the get-go; you might have to lead the way, and demonstrate what you need from them in order for the relationship to work.</p>



<p>Instead of leaving good communication to chance, it’s recommended that you put some <strong>basic guidelines</strong> in place before you sign the contract. In doing this, you can weed out any companies that do not have the capacity to meet your communication requirements.</p>



<p>Here are some key things to check before selecting an IT company:</p>



<h2>3 Key Areas to Check Before Choosing an IT Partner</h2>



<h3>1. Communication KPIs</h3>



<p>See if your IT company is willing to agree on some <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-should-set-kpis-for-your-it-company/">KPIs regarding communication</a>. For example, you could set a KPI to measure ‘response time’; how quickly they get back to you when you’ve reached out for help.</p>



<p>Whatever you decide on, put these KPIs in writing so you have something to refer to in the future if there is a communication breakdown.</p>



<h3>2. Face-to-face meetings and phone calls</h3>



<p>Some IT professionals like to hide behind their computers and rarely engage in face-to-face or telephone contact. While emails are perfectly adequate most of the time, there are situations where you’ll require verbal explanations to avoid things getting ‘lost in translation’.</p>



<p>What might take hours to explain via email could be resolved in a matter of minutes by picking up the phone. Make sure your chosen IT company has the capacity to accommodate these kinds of meetings on a regular basis.</p>



<h3>3. Willingness to teach</h3>



<p>When you first start working with an IT company, you might go through a steep learning curve as you process new information. This will be a lot easier if the IT professionals show a willingness to teach you about technologies you don’t understand. While this may involve a time commitment in the beginning, in the long-run, it will allow for a more cohesive, productive relationship for both parties.</p>
