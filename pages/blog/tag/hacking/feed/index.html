<p>Getting hacked is one of the things you often hear in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.hiscox.co.uk/sites/uk/files/documents/2018-02/Hiscox_Cyber_Readiness_Report_2018_FINAL.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 report</a>, 73% of businesses are not ready to respond to a cyber attack. </p>



<p>That means getting hacked is now a matter of <em>when</em>, not if.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to come to that. </p>



<p>There are a lot of things you can do to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">protect yourself from getting hacked</a>. You have to equip yourself with <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">basic cyber security terminologies</a>. Then, when you’re familiar, dive right in into our <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">non-technical guide to protecting your business online</a>. </p>



<p>But you may be asking… </p>



<h2>What Happens When You Get Hacked</h2>



<p>Getting hacked can mean a lot of things for different people. That’s why a lot of people still don’t take their online security seriously. </p>



<p>In this article, we’ve broken it down according to the levels of severity/effect on the victim.</p>



<p>Below are the five levels of hacking and what you can do to prevent it from happening. </p>



<h3>Level 1: Harmless Snooping </h3>



<p>The first level of hacking is when someone gains access to your data or information and does nothing about it. </p>



<p>For example, someone behind you at the train is ‘reading’ your email at the same time as you. Or someone who heard a private conversation you had with your spouse. Or a person who visited your office and saw some documents lying around…</p>



<p>This level doesn’t do any harm because the <em>unauthorized person</em> doesn’t do anything with the information. They just kept it to themselves and went about their regular day. Maybe they just used it as an interesting conversation over dinner with their spouse later that day. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 1 hacking</h4>



<p>This level won’t cause much harm, but if the person has some evil intentions, then it’s worth taking extra precautions. </p>



<p>If you’re worried about someone snooping around reading your phone or your computer in a cafe, the best way to avoid that is to <strong>position yourself with your back against the wall</strong>. That way, no one can see what’s on your screen. </p>



<p>Or if that’s not possible, use one of those screen filters that block viewing from certain angles. Meaning, only the person who is directly in front can see what’s on the screen. </p>



<p>Still can’t visualize this? Next time you go to the ATM, step a little to the left/right and try looking at it from the side instead of the front. You should not see anything on the screen. It&#8217;s going to be the same thing but for your devices. </p>



<h3>Level 2: The Prank</h3>



<p>The second level of hacking is when your data is used against you but in a harmless, light-hearted way. You know, the one you just laugh and tell stories about later.</p>



<p>Imagine drinking out with your buddies. You tell stories. You laugh. After a while, you go to the bathroom. Then, when you come back, you notice everyone chuckling. You keep asking why and they won’t tell you. You let it go. </p>



<p>Then, you check your phone. You saw Facebook has a ton of notifications. When you looked at it, everyone at the table suddenly burst into laughter. You then looked at it and one of your buddies posted something. </p>



<p>No harm done. Just your drunk buddies playing a prank on you. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 2 hacking</h4>



<p>If you haven’t already, <strong>add a passcode to your devices</strong>. Make it a habit to <em>lock</em> it before leaving it — whether that’s your phone or your computer. </p>



<p>Your password is useless if the device is already open. </p>



<p>For Mac users running on the latest OS (Mojave), simply press ‘command + ctrl + Q’ at the same time to lock your screen. If you’re using Windows 10, just press the ‘windows button + L’ to lock your screen. </p>



<p>And this goes without saying, if it’s portable enough, like your phone or tablet, and you’re in a public place like a cafe, please don’t leave it at the table when you go to the restroom, or order your drink. </p>



<h3>Level 3: Fraud</h3>



<p>Level 3 hacking is when the information accessed/stolen is used against you. This is the typical hacking you hear on the news where the hacker used the credit card of another person, or through other methods such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#phishing">phishing</a> or <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#ransomware">ransomware</a>. </p>



<p>Remember, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">70% of small and medium businesses have been targeted by a cyber attack</a>. So, don’t take this for granted. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 3 hacking</h4>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">General rules for protecting yourself online</a> applies here:</p>



<ul><li>Don’t open emails/links from someone you don’t know</li><li>Use strong and unique passwords</li><li>Use a multi-factor authentication</li><li>Use a VPN</li><li>Don’t connect to public Wi-Fis (if possible) </li></ul>



<p>Remember that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">technology</a> such as antivirus software can only protect you to an extent. You also have to do your part. </p>



<h3>Level 4: Breach</h3>



<p>Level 4 hacking goes beyond financial harm. Usually, the victim’s reputation takes a hit. It’s when other people are also affected in some way. </p>



<p>Remember the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/icloud-hacking-not-just-for-celebrities/">iCloud hacking of celebrities</a> that happened before? This can also happen to you. </p>



<p>Or if you’re a business, this will be the data breaches where your customers’ sensitive information is leaked to the public — leading to the<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/"> loss of trust of your customers</a>. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 4 hacking</h4>



<p>Preventing a level 4 hack starts at the <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/">top of your organization</a>. You have to know who are the most common targets and how to spot them in their tracks. </p>



<p>Then, a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-create-an-it-policy/">cyber security policy</a> is also key. You can’t expect your employees to know what you know, or even think about their online habits and how it may affect the entire organization. It’s up to you to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">communicate cyber security with your staff</a>. </p>



<h3>Level 5: Physical Harm</h3>



<p>Level 5 hacking is the most severe type because it causes physical harm to people. Unlike money which you can earn back later or reputational harm which you can repair over time, this type of hacking can lead to irreversible consequences such as injuries or death. </p>



<p>This is the type that you often see on movies where hackers cause sudden blackouts leading to chaos or hack into your cars to control them. </p>



<p>Still not convinced? Here’s a<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/physical-damage-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> list of cyber security attacks</a> that happened already resulting to physical harm, including tampering of HVAC systems in a hospital and the main control software of a German plant that resulted to a physical blast. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 5 hacking</h4>



<p>Preventing this level of hacking is similar to the ones described above. It takes just one mistake (a single infected USB thumb drive or an innocent click on an email) to allow hackers to get in your system. </p>



<p>If your organization doesn’t have the necessary skills or manpower to handle your cyber security, your best course of action is to <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/free-consult-booking/">hire an external IT partner</a> to assess your current state and work together to ensure you are ready for a cyber attack. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There’s a lot you can do to protect yourself from getting hacked. </p>



<p><strong>Remember, if something can connect to the internet, it can be hacked. </strong></p>



<p>No technology is 100% hack-proof. </p>



<p>You (and your employees) are the last line of defence when it comes to not getting hacked. </p>



<p>So, the question is, are you ready when that happens?</p>

<h2 id="what">What Is Cyber Security</h2>



<p><strong>Cyber security is the practice of protecting computer systems</strong> — including but not limited to computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, programs, networks — from theft or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data.</p>



<p>Other people also call this information technology security or electronic information security; or simply information security. </p>



<p>Another simple definition for cyber security is that it’s the <strong>protection of internet-connected systems</strong>, including hardware, software and data, from digital attacks.</p>



<h2 id="why">Why You Should Care About Cyber Security</h2>



<p>According to a report by HP, <a href="https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/almost-half-of-nz-businesses-unprepared-for-data-breaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of New Zealand Businesses aren’t prepared for a Cyber Attack</a>.</p>



<p>The reality is, more than <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">70% small and medium businesses have been targeted by a cyber attack</a>. The scary part is that most of them don’t even know they’ve been attacked, or worse, breached — meaning, someone was able to access confidential and sensitive information of your business.</p>



<p>Now, you’re probably asking…</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img width="560" height="315" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/More-than-70-percent-of-SMEs-targeted-by-cyber-attack.png" alt="More than 70 percent of SMEs targeted by cyber attack" class="wp-image-3291" title="Cyber Security 101: A Guide to Protecting Your Business Online 1"><figcaption>

<h3>What Happens When You Get Hacked</h3>



<p>There’s not really a straight-forward answer to this question, because there are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked/">different types of hacking</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, it can be as simple as someone posting a tweet using your business account saying “I got hacked by (blank).”</p>



<p>Or it can be very serious like adding passwords to all your files which leads to you not being able to access them (since you don’t know the password). You will then have to get in touch with the hacker to pay them a huge amount of money. Then they will send the <em>password</em> that will allow you to regain access to all your files.</p>



<p>This is an example of <strong>ransomware</strong>. It’s one of the most common types of cyber attack, which we’ll cover below.</p>



<p>Another type of hacking that has bigger repercussions is when personal information is leaked. This includes social media information, address, and job info like what happened in the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">PDL data breach</a>. </p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Because when personal data is leaked, we&#8217;re now talking about your physical security. When hackers gain access to your internet banking credentials, it&#8217;s only your money that is at risk. You can always earn it back. But when your physical safety is at risk, lives are at stake. </p>



<p>Consider the effects of these actions on your business:</p>



<h4><strong>Problem 1</strong>: Without the ability to access your data, your organization stops working.</h4>



<p>If you and your employees can’t connect to the internet or access your data, your organization stops working.</p>



<h4><strong>Problem 2</strong>: If organizational data gets breached/stolen, it can cost a huge amount of money and create animosity in the eyes of your customers.</h4>



<p>It’s only the first quarter in 2019, these types of news won’t stop soon.</p>



<h3>Costs of Cyber Attacks You’re Probably Not Aware Of</h3>



<p>When your business is involved in a data breach, two things happen:</p>



<ol><li>You lose revenues</li><li>You spend more</li></ol>



<p>The first downside of getting breached is you <strong>lose the trust of your customers</strong> (and would-be customers). This leads to lost revenues for your business. Apart from that, you’d have to <strong>spend more</strong> to recover what was lost in terms of salaries and fees, not to mention the penalties you may pay.</p>



<p>With lost revenues and added costs, that puts a big dent on your company’s profitability. And if you’re a small company without deep pockets, a cyber attack might put you out of business. </p>



<p>According to one <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/cyberattacks-cost-small-companies-200k-putting-many-out-of-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, over 60% of SMBs close shop within 6 months after a data breach and is <a href="https://www.hiscox.com/documents/2019-Hiscox-Cyber-Readiness-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costing businesses $200,000 on average</a>—which includes lost business, regulatory fines, and remediation costs</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">Don’t wait until your business gets hacked</a>!</p>



<p class="toc">The question you should be asking now is, “<strong>are you prepared for a cyber attack?</strong>” If your answer is not a definite yes, then you can benefit from our <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free cyber security assessment</a>. </p>



<h2 id="crucial-areas">7 Crucial Areas of Cyber Security You Need to Consider in Your Business</h2>



<p>Ensuring cyber security requires the coordination of efforts throughout an information system, which includes the following categories:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Network security</strong> is the process of securing a computer network from intruders, from both <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">direct and indirect attacks</a>.</li><li><strong>Application security</strong> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-data-stealing-android-malware-infiltrated-the-google-play-store-infecting-users-in-196-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compromised application</a> could provide access to the data of its users (and your business.</li><li><strong>Information security</strong> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit. This includes <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">protecting your backups</a> as well.</li><li><strong>Operational security</strong> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</li><li><strong>Disaster recovery and business continuity</strong> dictate how your business gets back on its feet and restore operations should a disaster or a cyber security breach that caused data loss occur.</li><li><strong>End-user education</strong> addresses the most unpredictable cyber security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Phishing attacks are the most common threat your staff should be knowledgeable about.</li><li><strong>Leadership commitment</strong> is the key to the successful implementation of any cyber security project. Without it, it is very difficult to establish, implement and maintain effective processes.</li></ol>



<p>One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the <strong>constantly evolving nature</strong> of security risks. This is also the main reason why there’s a shortage of talent in the industry.</p>



<p>And the main reason why you should have a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/free-consult-booking/">reliable IT partner</a> to stay on top of all these changes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/people-pointing-to-laptop-screen-1024x683.jpg" alt="important areas in cyber security no one is talking about" width="512" height="342" title="Cyber Security 101: A Guide to Protecting Your Business Online 2"></figure></div>



<h2>Two Additional Areas of Cyber Security No One Is Talking About</h2>



<h3>1. Mobile security</h3>



<p>Modern businesses are powered by a mobile workforce. As a business owner, you’re always on the go. You’re with your phone 24/7, talking to your customers, chatting with your team, accessing files and emails, and much more.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s vital that you keep your phone (and your employee’s devices) protected — both physically and digitally.</p>



<p>Start by adding a password/passcode to your devices. For ease of use, there are people who still don’t use them. Also, consider using a VPN, especially when using your device to connect to public Wi-Fis.</p>



<p>There have been cases where personal devices were the cause of security breaches. Even without any malicious intent, an employee may plug in a personal USB to bring in some documents to finish over the weekend can become the reason why your business gets hacked. </p>



<h3>2. Internet-of-things (IoT) security</h3>



<p>Technology is continuously making our lives easier and simpler. And it definitely is <em>invading </em>our homes and offices — from as simple as an automatic garage door opener, to the temperature control in your living room, to speakers that can play music and even make orders online; or smart printers where you just send an email to a specific address and it prints out automatically, or programmable coffee machines.</p>



<p>All these are conveniences brought about by technology.</p>



<p>However, they are not without risks. Unlike our computers, IoT devices do not have anti-virus software as their first line of defense.  </p>



<p>If these devices don’t have updated security protocols, a hacker can easily get in and gain access to all your devices. They can see you in your own CCTV, hear you in your speakers, and everything else you see in movies.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s important to keep yourself protected. The best way to do this is to <strong>update your software/firmware</strong> and <strong>add passwords</strong> to your devices.</p>



<p>For more tips on how to protect yourself, read this article on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">how to avoid getting hacked</a>.</p>



<h2 id="pillars">3 Pillars of Cyber Security You Need to Focus On</h2>



<p>If you’re keen on understanding and implementing cyber security for your business, there are three areas (or pillars) you need to look into: people, processes and technology.</p>



<p>This three-pronged approach helps organisations defend themselves from both organised attacks and common internal threats, such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">accidental breaches and human error</a>.</p>



<h3>1. Technology</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">Technology</a></strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/"> encompasses both software and hardware</a>. The most common one you are probably using is antivirus software. But, as you may probably know, none of these is perfect. Some <em>will</em> get through the cracks. That&#8217;s why the other two pillars are important. </p>



<h3>2. Processes</h3>



<p>Processes are your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/no-cyber-security-policy/">policies</a> and how you company deals with online security and protection. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>How you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">protect and backup your data</a>, </li><li>BYOD policies (Bring Your Own Device), </li><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-steps-to-help-you-recover-from-targeted-cyber-attack/">What you do in the event of a breach</a>, and </li><li>How you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">communicate cyber security to your staff</a></li></ul>



<h3>3. People</h3>



<p>According to one study, people have a contribution to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">96% of all breaches</a>. Without any <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyberwise-free-trial/">continuous education on best practices</a>, your organisation could be next. Learn the most <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/">common targets in your organisation</a> and how you can avoid them.</p>



<p>And if you’re looking at something you can do today to protect yourself, you can <strong>enroll in our 4-day email course on passwords</strong> below. In this series, you’ll learn exactly how “secure” your password is and what you should do to keep them safe.</p>

<h2 id="common-threats">Most Common Cyber Security Threats to Your Business</h2>



<h3>1. Malware</h3>



<p>Malware, short for <em>mal</em>icious soft<em>ware</em>, is any software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer. It’s the <em>general</em> term for viruses, trojans, etc.</p>



<h3>2. Ransomware</h3>



<p>Ransomware is a type of malware designed to extort money by blocking access to files/computers until <em>ransom</em> is paid. This is the example we wrote above.

<h3>3. Social Engineering</h3>



<p>Social engineering is a tactic that aims to convince a user to disclose sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers by impersonating other people. The most common social engineering example involves someone posing as the CEO and sends an email to the accounting/finance department to transfer money to a “supplier.”</p>



<h3>4. Phishing</h3>



<p>Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails (or any other communication platform like SMS or calls) that resemble messages coming from reputable sources with the intention of stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information.</p>

<h2 id="terms">7 Most Common Cyber Security Terms You Need to Know</h2>



<p>Apart from the most common threats you may face in your business, there are other <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">cyber security terms</a> you need to be familiar with. These terms are often in news sites. A better understanding will greatly help you reduce the risks to you and your business.</p>



<h3>1. Vulnerability</h3>



<p>A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control.</p>



<p><em>Remember the 3 pillars of cyber security above? If one of them, say your technology, isn’t updated, a hacker can easily get in your systems. </em></p>



<h3>2. Denial-of-service (DoS)</h3>



<p>DoS attacks are designed to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users.</p>



<p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/toyota-cyber-attack-leaves-employees-unable-to-access-emails-for-days-20190221-p50z70.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>what happened to Toyota</em></a><em> last February where the staff can’t access their emails for days. </em></p>



<h3>3. Spoofing</h3>



<p>Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.</p>



<p><em>This is similar to phishing in the sense that hackers try to deceive the person receiving it, but the main difference is that spoofing is for delivery whereas phishing is for retrieval. You won’t knowingly download a malware, right? But if someone tricked you into clicking a link, say about your business getting sued, you will most likely click on it. That will then lead to a download of some sort of malware. </em></p>



<h3>4. Adware</h3>



<p>Adware is a form of malware, malicious or not, that hides on your device and displays advertisements on a computer. Some adware also monitors your behavior online so it can target you with specific ads.</p>



<p><em>A common sign that you have adware is when your browser’s homepage changes into something else, i.e. when you open it, a website automatically loads instead of your default page. </em></p>



<h3>5. Spyware</h3>



<p>Spyware is a form of malware that hides on your device, monitors your activity, and steals sensitive information like bank details and passwords.</p>



<p><em>One example of spyware is a keystroke logger, or keylogger (see below).</em></p>



<h3>6. Keylogger</h3>



<p>Keyloggers secretly records what you <em>type</em> on your computers and devices. Employers use keyloggers to watch employees, but cybercriminals use them too.</p>



<p><em>On its own, you can track productivity levels and what people do, but when used maliciously, you can steal credit card information and other sensitive data. </em></p>



<h3>7. Trojan</h3>



<p>Trojans are software programs that claims to do A, but does B instead. They can take the form of attachments, downloads, and fake videos/programs.</p>



<p><em>Taking its name from the Greek Mythology, the trojan horse allows a hacker to get into your system by promising to do one thing (offering to Athena), but also allowing the hacker to do other things (get inside Troy).</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/01/apple-sold-a-record-number-of-iphones-but-just-barely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2016</a>, Apple revealed that 1 billion people are using its services, such as iTunes and the App store. This statistic includes iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, and Apple Watch users. Think about that number for a second. 1 billion people. That’s an enormous amount of the world’s population.</p>



<p>Over the years Apple has earned a reputation for being less vulnerable to hacks and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> threats when compared to other products, but security breaches do happen from time to time.</p>



<p>iCloud hacking is a real threat and can have real consequences.</p>



<p>In 2014, this lesson was learned the hard way by celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton, whose photos were leaked by an anonymous iCloud hacker. If a celebrity’s account can be breached, so can yours.</p>



<h3>So what can you do to avoid an iCloud hack?</h3>



<p>The most important thing is to <strong>protect your Apple ID</strong>. </p>



<p>As Apple users will know, your Apple ID is essentially your own personal identification code when using Apple products. It allows you to make purchases, send messages, access iCloud data, and more. </p>



<p>If your Apple ID is compromised, hackers will have access to your personal information, not to mention they may shop up a storm in iTunes or the App Store.</p>



<h2>4 Ways a Hacker Could Obtain Your Apple ID:</h2>



<h3>1. Password hack</h3>



<p><strong>Weak or obvious passwords</strong> are more susceptible to attacks. Be sure to use a unique password and do not reveal it to anyone. It’s also worth noting that if you use the same password across multiple accounts, and one of your accounts is compromised, then the hacker could go after your Apple ID next.</p>



<p>Want to find out if your password is weak or strong? Try <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entering it here</a>. </p>



<p>Now, what did it say? </p>



<p>How long will it take for a computer to crack your password? Seconds? months? years? </p>



<p>Try entering a couple more of your passwords to find out which ones are easy for hackers to crack. If the password you use is easy to crack, please change it now. Most likely, that password has been <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/discover-email-addresses-used-in-dark-web/">circulating the dark web</a> already. </p>

</div>



<h3>2. Phishing scam</h3>



<p>A <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#phishing">phishing</a> scam is when someone contacts you, usually via email, appearing to be an Apple employee or representative. Often these emails will direct you towards a fake website. </p>



<p>If you enter your details on this fake website, then your Apple ID will likely be hacked.</p>



<h3>3. Someone you know</h3>



<p>It’s easier to think of hackers as mysterious enemies on the internet, but sometimes people in your network may be the culprit. If someone has physical access to your Apple device, they could install malicious software. </p>



<p>Try to limit the number of people who can access your phone (ideally, you should be the only one using it), and be careful not to leave it unattended in public spaces).</p>



<p>We went through this briefly in another article: <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked/">what exactly happens when you get hacked</a>.</p>



<h3>4. Theft</h3>



<p>Of course, another major risk is theft. If your Apple product is stolen, take steps to lock down or deactivate the advice as soon as possible. There’s always a chance that it could have been stolen by a hacker who is using it to access your personal information.</p>



<p>As you can see, there are several incidences where your Apple ID – and therefore your iCloud – could be vulnerable to attack. </p>



<p>The key thing to remember is: <strong>don’t be complacent</strong>. </p>



<p>Just because your Apple product isn’t susceptible to the same viruses as your Windows products doesn’t mean it can’t be breached.</p>



<p>Make sure you take advantage of all the security features Apple provides, such as two-step verification and lock codes. Apple releases these security features for a reason – follow security best practice to protect your privacy and avoid iCloud hacks.</p>
