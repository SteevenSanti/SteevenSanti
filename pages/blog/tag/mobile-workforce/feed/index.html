<p>A mobilised workforce no longer just means handing out cell phone to your employees.&nbsp;In fact, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">using IT to mobilise and manage your workforce</a> is about available capabilities that many are still very unaware of.</p>



<h2>4 Questions You Need to Ask Yourself to Manage Your Mobile Workforce</h2>



<h3>1. What could it mean for your business?</h3>



<p>From increased productivity to greater visibility and management over tasks, a mobilised workforce enables everyone to be more flexible about where and when they work – a benefit for your business as well as your employees.</p>



<p>Imagine field reps not having to collect information to send back to the office for someone else to input into&nbsp;a database, or those who travel a lot not having to worry about missing out on access to important documentation&nbsp;for their role.</p>



<p>There really is no end to the benefits available to those organisations who promote and encourage a&nbsp;mobilised workforce.</p>



<p>Outside of the internal business unit, it also allows you to meet the increasing demand for mobility from consumers, customers and clients. Not being up-to-date with <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">current trends in technology</a> will mean inconvenience for those who deal with your business or organisation, and if it’s not easy, then it may not be worth returning for.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-use-it-to-increase-business-profitability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to: Use IT to increase business profitability</a></p>



<h3>2. What kind of technology do you need?</h3>



<p>You need to think past just the hardware, as software and other online applications will also be required in order to mobilise your workforce. Once you do start your search for the right technology for your business, it can be hard to not be overwhelmed by the possibilities available – but this is where you head back to your strategic plans, and work out what goals you have in place.</p>



<p>Once you re-focus on them, you will have a clearer picture on <strong>what it is you actually need</strong> – rather than just choosing something for the sake of it being a fancy application or gadget.</p>



<h3>3. What are the risks associated with a mobile workforce?</h3>



<p>From logging into company systems from a home computer, to exposing data via public internet access, there are plenty of risks that come with a mobilised workforce.</p>



<p>But like anything that exposes our businesses to outside threats, as long as we are prepared and have a plan of action in response to them, then it isn’t something that should get in the way of advancing an organisation through technology.</p>



<p>Take a look at these <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">21 tips to avoid getting hacked</a>.</p>



<h3>4. What if you need something a little bit special?</h3>



<p>Again, this goes back to what kind of technology you actually need for your business to function. If you have a standard operating system then there is probably already something out there to cover your needs.</p>



<p>But if you have a niche service or product, then it may be a case of having to develop something specific for your organisation – which is okay! This is a very common occurrence and happening on a daily basis for those businesses who are forward-thinking about what technology could do for them.</p>



<h2>How Do I Plan My Mobilisation?</h2>



<p>Working your way through these seven key points, ask yourself ‘how would further mobilisation affect…’</p>



<ol><li>Productivity</li><li>Collaboration</li><li>Applications</li><li>Connectivity</li><li>Security</li><li>Data</li><li>Management</li></ol>



<p>Once you have some clear considerations around how a mobilised workforce could benefit your business, create a series of strategic action points to work towards achieving those technology goals. This way you can ensure you track progress, ROI, and have clear measurements to show your businesses growth and change.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">80% of computer problems</a> are caused by human error.</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. You can have the best computers, the most powerful anti‐virus programme known to man, every type of security system possible to protect your data and devices and people will still manage to find a way around them.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why you&#8217;d often hear about the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">3 pillars of cyber security</a> where one of them is always people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>‘Computer’ means more than your PC and laptop.</p>



<p>Your tablet and smartphone are mobile computers that can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/which-employees-are-your-biggest-security-risk/">increase the productivity and risks</a> of most businesses.</p>



<p>Most of the time such breaches will be accidental and not malicious in nature, but that doesn’t make the resulting problem any less damaging for your company.</p>



<p>All organisations face different challenges. Regardless of team size or industry, sometimes the biggest challenge in a business can be getting everyone in a room to for a 30‐minute talk. Research has shown that over all the programmes, systems and software you can install, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">educating your employees about online security and mobile risk</a> is the best way to protect your business.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/risks-of-using-wireless-technology-in-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How employees use of mobile technology puts your network security at risk</a></p>



<h2>3 Steps to Develop Online Security Awareness in Your Organisation</h2>



<h3>Step 1: Create and Engage</h3>



<p>The first step is to have a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/no-cyber-security-policy/">basic security and information policy</a>. It can be included in employment contracts or employee handbooks, but is best discussed in person. Your policy should cover which devices each employee has access to and what they can be used for. Use the time to educate your team on how they can protect the company and why their actions are important.</p>



<p>Younger generations often feel like their online actions are anonymous and have no real repercussions. It’s hard to measure personal impact if the consequences happen in another part of the city, country or world. Overcoming this mind set is essential for building a mobile aware culture.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Measure and Monitor</h3>



<p>The next step is using firewalls, mobile device management (MDM) or policy engines to measure, monitor and enforce these policies. It’s important that employees can still do their jobs without the added security impacting their usability or productivity. These programmes will also allow you to see if anyone is trying to access files, sites, or share information they shouldn’t. This gives you a chance to chat with that person one‐on‐one and ensure they fully understand the policy.</p>



<h3>Step 3: Feedback and Adjust</h3>



<p>Just as social media allows two‐way conversation with businesses and clients, your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-create-an-it-policy/">IT security policy</a> should also allow for employee feedback and requests. There’s no benefit in having mobile aware staff if the security policy prevents them from doing their job properly. Policies and programmes can be changed to suit different requirements, so make sure there are opportunities for your team to have input.</p>



<p>51% of employees across 23 countries surveyed by Aruba Networks said <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-it-to-mobilise-and-manage-your-workforce/">mobile technologies</a> enable them to be more productive and engaged. There’s no way of avoiding it! In this day and age if a business tried doing away with cell phones, tablets and laptops it wouldn’t take long to be left behind by their competition.</p>



<p>Given the always‐on, mobile office is here to stay, your best move for developing a mobile aware culture is working with changes. Take an adaptive policy approach to connectivity and data security that educates and encourages your employees while protecting your business.</p>

<p>A lot of organisations still only see IT as an expense – a cost to the business that adds no particular value, apart from it being a necessity to function (like power/water etc). But what if you could use IT to increase business profitability?  </p>



<p>So it was seen as an investment and was able to provide efficiencies that allowed the organisation to focus on growing. Who wouldn’t put their hand up for that? So how could it work? </p>



<p>Take these examples; </p>



<h2>6 Ways IT Can Increase Business Profitability</h2>



<h3>1. Virtualisation</h3>



<p>Virtualisation is the creation of a virtual form of something in IT –  from a network to storage, hardware or a server. </p>



<p>So basically this means you can consolidate and run apps on fewer physical servers,  increasing deployment rates and reducing operational costs. It will also provide you with the flexibility of moving and balancing loads depending on requirements  &#8211; something that is highly recommended if you have unpredictable rates of usage, for example, if you are launching a large project which will put a strain on the current operating system. </p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Poor IT will cost a business significantly. Here&#8217;s how to do it the right way</a>. </p>



<h3>2. VoiP and Cloud phone systems</h3>



<p>If you don’t yet use VoiP (voice over IP), you’re missing out on a big opportunity to reduce operating costs. Some estimates have said that the implementation of VoiP in business could save them up to 50 percent of their traditional phone bill. </p>



<p>From phone plans, through to messaging and video conferencing, VoiP and Cloud phone systems aid productivity in the workplace by offering a reliable, unified communication system. </p>



<h3>3. Maximising efficiency</h3>



<p>There is little doubt that being able to use technology to increase efficiency is one of the best ways for a business to see profitable benefits. </p>



<p>Project management systems are a great example of how individuals and teams can collaborate on tasks together but reduce the time required to have ‘catch-up’ meetings, and to update others about what they need to be doing – and of course, this is particularly important for those who don’t work in the same place. </p>



<p>Another software you can look at are collaboration tools such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> that can enable your team to work together efficiently. </p>



<h3>4. Automating tasks</h3>



<p>Think about all the things that occur in your organisation on a daily basis – are there any processes that are carried out over and over by an individual, or even a team?&nbsp; </p>



<p>Now think about if you were able to implement an automated system around that task. For example – remember when paying by credit card meant someone had to take a physical impression of it onto carbon paper? </p>



<p>Today it’s just a simple scan of a machine and the payment is processed, so more transactions can take place faster. </p>



<p>By maximising output, there’s no doubt – due to the economies of scale &#8211; that profits are then able to be increased, as it will take less time for a particular task to be carried out. </p>



<h3>5. Provide first-class service to your customers</h3>



<p>A customer relationship management (CRM) system is a must for any business. And one that has multiple functionalities will allow you to customise your solutions or products to cater for their needs – which obviously results in better customer experience, and repeat business (as well as an increase in referrals). </p>



<p>For example, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.customermonitor.com/blog/how-do-you-calculate-a-net-promoter-score" target="_blank">Net Promoter Score software</a>&nbsp;allows you to capture a wide range of thoughts and feelings from your customers, and take action on those results. </p>



<h3>6. Mobile technology and remote access</h3>



<p>By using technology to make your business <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/modern-workforce/">mobile and remotely accessible</a>, you are making your products and/or services available to a  larger market. However, it is important to realise it’s not just about providing people with mobile phones – as there is a bit more involved than simply being armed with devices. </p>



<p>But once the technology is established, it will open up many new opportunities for your business to grow and increase profits. &#8212;&#8212; This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business? <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/"><strong>Download:&nbsp;An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity</strong></a></p>
