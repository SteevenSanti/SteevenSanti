<p>Apps abound everywhere. Because
of their popularity, we’ve become extremely reliant on them to get our
day-to-day work done. One such tool is Canva — a graphic-design tool website
that allows you to easily create stunning graphics by simple drag-and-drop.</p>



<p>But in May 2019, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Canva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva suffered a data breach</a> that impacted 137 million subscribers. The exposed data included email addresses, usernames, names, cities of residence and passwords. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_n9n0uton1h videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="swatch" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" title="Canva Website Breach and PDL Data Breach 2019 3"></div></div></div></div>



<p>But, did you know that another
breach was found just last month? </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed data</a> from data enrichment company People Data
Labs (PDL) contained over 622 million email addresses. While this isn’t as big
as the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1 breach</a> earlier this year, this should concern
you more. </p>



<p>While the collection is
impressive for its sheer volume, the data doesn&#8217;t include sensitive information
like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. It does,
though, contain profiles of hundreds of millions of people that include home
and cell phone numbers, associated social media profiles like Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github, work histories seemingly scraped from LinkedIn,
almost 50 million unique phone numbers, and 622 million unique email addresses.
&#8211; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/billion-records-exposed-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired</a></p>



<p>As more and more breaches and cyber security incidents happen, the more we all have to learn how we can protect ourselves online. Below are three things you should do immediately after learning that your data as part of a breach. </p>



<h2>3 Things You Need to Do Immediately After a Data Breach</h2>



<h3>1. Change your passwords</h3>



<p>The moment you learn of a data
breach, especially if you are part of the breach, it’s the perfect time to
change your password. </p>



<p>To those asking, a data breach
or leak doesn’t necessarily mean your account was accessed. It’s possible, yes.
But unless you can speak with the hacker, you can’t be 100% sure. </p>



<p>This leaves you with the next
best course of action — change your password. </p>



<p>To ensure you won’t risk
getting hacked again, we’ve created a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">4-day email course on creating and using stronger passwords</a>.
</p>



<h3>2. Don’t reuse passwords</h3>



<p>91% understand the risk of reusing
passwords, but 55% do it anyway. </p>



<p>Please, if you want to remain
safe online, stop reusing passwords. </p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Because it’s very difficult to
remember unique passwords for all our accounts. </p>



<p>Quick question: when was the
last time you counted how many accounts and profiles you have? </p>



<p>Me? I have <strong>348 accounts</strong>
accounted for. Possibly even more. </p>



<p>Now, if you have over 300+
accounts, which you most likely do, can you remember strong, unique passwords
for every one of them? </p>



<p>Maybe, but it’s no easy feat. </p>



<p>The only way to <em>remember</em>
all your passwords without having to remember them is to use a password
manager. </p>



<p>That’s also the reason how I
knew I have 348 accounts. It’s the easiest way to manage all my accounts — from
email addresses, various social media accounts, WiFi passwords, tools like
Canva, and many more. </p>



<p>Learn how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">use
password managers and stop reusing passwords</a> by watching this free
video.</p>



<h3>3. Understand the repercussions</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinny Troia</a>, a dark web researcher, said &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen all these social media profiles collected and merged with user profile information into a single database on this scale. From the perspective of an attacker, if the goal is to impersonate people or hijack their accounts, you have names, phone numbers, and associated account URLs. That&#8217;s a lot of information in one place to get you started.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. </p>



<p>What information have you posed
on your social media accounts? </p>



<ul><li>Birthdays</li><li>Pets</li><li>Family
members and who’s related to whom</li></ul>



<p><strong>Aren’t these the same
information we use as passwords or security questions? </strong></p>



<p>If all that information is in
one place, it wouldn’t be difficult for someone to reset your passwords and
gain access to your accounts. </p>



<p>That is unless you enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA). </p>



<p>Without MFA, anyone with these data can try resetting the passwords to your accounts easily. Watch this video to learn the importance of MFA. </p>

<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> is a topic you should take seriously,
especially when it comes to your business. The risks and too great for you to
ignore. </p>



<p>In today’s increasingly
connected world, it’s almost impossible to not use apps and other online
accounts. That’s why it’s a must that we protect our data, our business’ data. </p>



<p>For a primer on how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">create better, stronger passwords</a>, enroll in our 4-day
email course. You can also watch this video if you want to learn how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">remember
all your passwords using a password manager</a>. </p>

<p>No one wants to have their emails hacked. But you might already be the next target. You just don’t know it yet. Or, looking at it from another perspective, <b>you might already be hacked, you just don&#8217;t know it yet</b>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> is very important for individuals and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-773-million-record-collection-1-data-reach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Troy Hunt</a>, about 1.2B unique combination of email address and passwords were leaked to the public. This data breach, called Collection #1, was hosted (now deleted) on MEGA, a popular cloud storage service.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check here if your email address</a> was included in this breach, or in any previous breaches. But whatever result you find, we suggest you change your passwords right now.</p>



<h2>Two Tips to Protect Yourself from Getting Hacked</h2>



<h3>1. Use a password manager</h3>



<p>If you aren’t already, we also recommend using a password manager.</p>



<p>This helps you create unique passwords every time you need one.</p>



<p>One of the main reason we use the same password across all our accounts is we have a hard time remembering multiple ones, much more the complicated passwords such as “sG27FG#sfsdg$%” — which you probably already know is harder to hack and safer than “lucythepug.”</p>



<p>So, instead of using your dog’s name in all your passwords, the password manager will take care of creating unique passwords for you. Most password managers also have apps and browser plugins. This ensures that you don’t spend a lot of time searching and typing for your passwords when you want to access Facebook or Instagram. When you load the website, your username and passwords auto populate the fields. If you have multiple accounts for the same site (like multiple Gmail accounts), you can choose from the list of accounts saved in the password manager, just click on it, then it populates the fields for you.</p>



<h3>2. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h3>



<p>Another anti-hacking tip that we strongly recommend is using multi-factor authentication. This prevents people from accessing your accounts without you knowing it.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, MFA uses another device/app to verify whether you’re really the one logging in your account.</p>



<p>For example, when you login to your email, after entering your password, you will have to enter another code that is generated by the app/device you have chosen for your authentication.</p>



<p>It can also be a simple text message with a code which you then enter before you can access your email, or an app like Google Authenticator, which does exactly the same thing.</p>



<p>Whatever you choose, this is <strong>much safer than just relying on your passwords</strong>. </p>



<p>While you think this may slow you down, that additional 5 seconds will save you the headache later on.</p>



<p>Watch this video to find out how you can get hacked without even knowing it. </p>

<p>Also, you actually don’t need to do this every time you login the site. If you have your own computer, you can stay logged in your account. That means you don’t have to authenticate every time you use the service.</p>



<p>Just last Monday, New Zealand’s cyptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.police.govt.nz/news/release/investigation-involving-crypto-currency-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cryptopia suffered a security breach</a> which resulted in significant losses.</p>



<p>As more consumers and businesses depend on the internet more and more, cyber threats like these will only increase. So, instead of thinking that you won’t be hacked, or waiting for you to get hacked before you do something about it, you can start by following these two simple tips.</p>



<p>Change your passwords today.</p>



<p>Use a password manager and enable multi-factor authentication.</p>
