<p>Wondering whether to purchase WatchGuard’s innovative Reputation Enabled Defense solution? We’ve got the lowdown on this clever product and how it can protect your business.</p>



<p>First things first, what is Reputation Enabled Defense? Developed by WatchGuard, it’s an innovative product that protects users from malicious web pages and other online threats without negatively impacting on page load times or putting unnecessary pressure on your antivirus software. It’s all about increasing efficiency, creating a safer web browsing experience, and&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">improving your overall cyber security</a>&nbsp;defences.</p>



<p>If you want fast, secure, high-performance security software, then Reputation Enabled Defense is a great place to start.&nbsp;Here are&nbsp;the top seven benefits of this product.</p>



<h2>Top 7 Benefits of WatchGuard&#8217;s Reputation Enabled Defense</h2>



<h3>1. Pre-Antivirus scanning</h3>



<p>One of the problems of installing multiple security features is that things like files and URLs are scanned multiple times, and therefore risk slowing down your computer or putting extra pressure on certain programs.</p>



<p>With Reputation Enabled Defense, all URLs will be scanned before they go through your Antivirus system. If the URL is found to be problematic, then the connection will be dropped without delay. And if the URL is safe, then it can skip the antivirus software altogether, hereby increasing efficiency and avoiding double handling.</p>



<p>All of this results in an impressive 30-50% savings on web processing.</p>



<h3>2. Cloud-based</h3>



<p>Reputation Enabled Defense is a&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/risk-management-and-the-cloud/">cloud-based</a>&nbsp;program, so it’s not slowed down by the speed or connection of your computer. Highly powerful, it scans data from multiple sources to protect your network from threats.</p>



<h3>3. Real-time&nbsp;monitoring</h3>



<p>Malicious links don’t take a holiday, so neither does Reputation Enabled Defense. The program uses real-time monitoring to pick up on problems as and when they happen – not a few hours too late.</p>



<h3>4. Botnet exposure</h3>



<p>Worried about botnets and control nodes? Reputation Enabled Defense is designed to pick up on these pesky problems without delay.</p>



<h3>5. Faster web surfing</h3>



<p>Since Reputation Enabled Defense skips your antivirus software when scanning URLs (see first point), it actually results in faster, more enjoyable web browsing. It’s quick to process each URL thanks to reputation scores, which are stored in a local cache.</p>



<h3>6. Added flexibility</h3>



<p>If the thought of installing one more security feature makes you want to pull your hair out, don’t worry – this program can be seamlessly integrated with other WatchGuard services.</p>



<p>This means that everything can be managed from one interface, saving your IT administrators from bouncing between different programs. Your IT team will love the flexible, adaptable structure.</p>



<h3>7. Top notch reporting</h3>



<p>As with all security features, often the best value comes from analysing the reports and identifying the threats that have been avoided. Reputation Enabled Defense produces <strong>informative reports</strong> designed to educate administrators about the risks lurking in their environment, so your IT team can be better informed and plan for the future.</p>

<p>You don’t need to work for a spy agency to be a whistle‐blower. In this age of IT anyone can take it upon themselves to be an Edward Snowden and share sensitive work material with the rest of the world.</p>



<p>Once published, it can never be undone.</p>



<p>So what can you do to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">protect your business’ online reputation?</a></p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/developing-online-security-and-mobile-risk-awareness-in-your-organisation/">Mobile Device Management</a> (MDM) can help employees stay productive and connected without breaching work policies. An MDM server or software can secure emails, work documents on smartphones, and make sure only people who need to access certain files can do so.</p>



<p>All MDM products are built with containment in mind. Work documents, files, and emails are encrypted and processed inside a ‘container’ within your employees phone that keeps it separate from their personal files. Employees can then access what they need when they need to, but are prevented from downloading and sharing documents to others outside the company. Your work data will be secure at all times.</p>



<p>A <strong>firewall</strong> is a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/iot-network-and-endpoint-security-challenges/">network security system</a> that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic, creating a barrier between trusted company intranet, and outside networks like the internet. In some cases, this might prevent a work computer from connecting to the internet at all, or just some selected sites to stop employees browsing social media or TradeMe on company time.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/risks-of-using-wireless-technology-in-business/" target="_blank">How employee use of mobile technology puts your network security at risk</a></p>



<p>Firewalls are two‐way barriers, so if they pick up on a suspicious attachment sent to you or detect an incoming virus, they can stop it from reaching your inbox or spreading to other computers on your network. Firewalls can also detect if someone is trying to access files they shouldn’t, if they are trying to copy them onto a USB drive or send them via email and stop them.</p>



<p>A <strong>proxy server</strong> is another kind of firewall that acts as a gateway from one network to another. They are very good at stopping outside hackers from accessing your internal network and stealing your work files.</p>



<p>By preventing people within your company either intentionally or unintentionally leaking data you protect your company from two‐fold reputational damage. The first is the damage those documents cause: The loss of IP, or sensitive information that gives you an edge in a competitive industry is shared with everyone. The second is losing your client’s trust and their accounts.</p>



<p>Would you give your business to a company if you didn’t trust them to keep your private data secure?</p>



<p>Unlikely.</p>



<p>Your business will lose face and lose clients, and even if you add every possible security measure under the sun you may never regain the trust and reputation you held before the breach.</p>



<p>MDM, firewalls, and proxy servers aren’t essential to business. Your computers and devices will work just fine without them, and you may never think of them… until after you need them. Reputations are built over a lifetime and lost in a moment, so think about how you can protect your business before it’s too late.</p>
