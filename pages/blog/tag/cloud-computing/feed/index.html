										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Does your business have an unfair advantage in today’s competitive environment? Or are you simply “getting by” or “barely surviving”? </p>



<p>Is your business thriving in today’s digital age? Or are you still relying on outdated technology while your competitors are investing in new, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">emerging technologies</a>? </p>



<p>We all know that the market is constantly changing. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/3-undeniable-challenges-facing-new-zealand-businesses-today/">Customers are always expecting more</a> from you — more value for less money. </p>



<p>The only way to remain relevant is to adapt to these changes. </p>



<p>And that means your business has to go through a digital transformation. </p>



<h2>What Is Digital Transformation</h2>



<p>Now, what exactly is digital transformation? </p>



<p>For most people, it’s about going paperless. And while going paperless is definitely a part of it, digital transformation goes beyond that, especially if you look at it from an organizational perspective. </p>



<p>Digital transformation is the use of new, fast, and frequently changing digital technologies to create — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. </p>



<h2>Digital Transformation Examples</h2>



<p>An easy way to understand digital transformation is to look at our personal lives. Below are three examples of how digital transformation has completely permeated our lives. </p>



<h3>Example 1: File Storage</h3>



<p>Before, if you want to save the photos and files in your computers and phones, you would have to buy an external hard drive. But now, because of the availability of online storage providers services, you don’t need to buy that hard drive anymore. Some popular brands out there are Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud. </p>



<h3>Example 2: Movies and Entertainment</h3>



<p>Or let’s say you wanted to watch a movie that isn’t on the big screen right now. </p>



<p>Today, you would just open up your Netflix or Hulu or Amazon account, and you can stream any movie or TV series available. </p>



<p>For those who aren’t familiar, there was a time where you would have to go to a video store, buy or rent a DVD or VHS, go back to your house, and plug it into a specific player before you can watch that movie. </p>



<p>After which you’ll have to return it (if you only rented it), or find a place at home to store all those CDs. </p>



<h3>Example 3: Music</h3>



<p>This goes the same for music. </p>



<p>Before Spotify and (insert name here), the only way for you go get your music is to buy them from record stores. The latest medium for music before it went <em>digital</em> is in the form of CDs as well. Before that, they were in cassettes. </p>



<p>And just like playing movies, you’d have bought a specific player for you to play your music. Heard of the Sony Walkman? </p>



<p>Now, we can do all the things we listed above (and more) with just our phones. That’s how much digital transformation has influenced our lives. </p>



<p>But this doesn’t seem to be the case for businesses. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Digital transformation is the use of new, fast, and frequently changing digital technologies to create — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. </p></blockquote>



<h2>Digital Transformation for Businesses</h2>



<p>Another way to look at digital transformation is by using cloud computing while reducing reliance on user-owned hardware. This is what we’ll be focusing on— <strong>The ROI to businesses when they invest in digital transformation</strong>. </p>



<p>One of the reasons why most New Zealand businesses haven’t invested in digital transformation goes back to IT service providers like us. Oftentimes, we make such a big deal out of it that it makes things complicated for people like you. </p>



<p>That’s why most business leaders stay away from it. Instead, they rely on what is familiar to them. </p>



<p>Technology has permeated every aspect of our personal lives. We have powerful computers in our pockets, smart devices, and home automation systems. </p>



<p>But in the workplace, a lot of businesses are still using technology like it was in the 90s or early 2000s. </p>



<p>In today’s fast-changing world, it becomes critical to adapt to these changes. Otherwise, you’d get left behind. </p>



<p>No doubt you have heard of stories of big brands becoming irrelevant simply because they failed to adapt to these changes. They conducted business as if it was status quo while the rest of the market changed. </p>



<p>They <strong>chose to ignore</strong> that the times are changing and that’s the reason why they failed. </p>



<p><a href="http://content.quanton.co.nz/blog/the-digital-revolution-its-not-about-technology?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=79515284&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--21Hs00AsJTXl1K-qYqu81e71nzFWiaOj-dZ080Kcbyun9Ih12Zgdiuu20qYq92eP6jDKtIsub_OSkgHO5jkrnnVBs2g&amp;_hsmi=79515284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology is not the solution by itself</a>. Rather, it’s a tool that will allow you to overcome the challenges you’re facing in your business right now. </p>



<p>Digital transformation is a complex topic, but it doesn’t have to be. We broke down digital transformation into four separate categories. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick overview&#8230;<br></p>



<h2>Overview of Digital Transformation</h2>



<h3>No. 1: Build a Strong Foundation</h3>



<p>First, you’ll need to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/build-strong-foundation/">build a strong foundation</a>. </p>



<p>As you already know, <strong>implementing change in your business is difficult</strong>. Without the commitment from top management, people don’t put in enough effort to make the change succeed. Without input from the end-users, new technology is often seen as a fad, pushed down their throats — making it difficult to accept the change initiative, and at times, actively sabotage the initiative. </p>



<p>And just like when building a house, if you don’t start with a strong foundation, everything you put on top crumbles easily. </p>



<h3>No. 2: Cloud-Based Email: Higher Productivity at Lower Costs</h3>



<p>After setting up a strong foundation, the next step is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cloud-based-email/">migrate your email to the cloud</a>. If you’re new to using cloud technology, this is the easiest transition you can make. </p>



<p>The main goal here is a <strong>seamless transition</strong> from your email server to a cloud-based one. Your staff leaves the office on Friday afternoon. They come back on Monday morning as if nothing happened. </p>



<p>Using a cloud-based email will help your organisation be more productive while lowering your costs. Now, that’s a good investment. </p>



<h3>No. 3: Work Better: Implementing a Hub for Teamwork</h3>



<p>It’s no secret that the faster you adapt to the changing customer demands, the better your business will be in the long-run. </p>



<p>The simplest way for your entire organisation to adapt faster is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/work-better-implementing-hub-for-teamwork/">communicate faster and work more efficiently</a>. And the tool that will help you achieve that is a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">collaboration and communication software</a>. </p>



<h3>No. 4: Shared Storage for Everyone: Never Deal with Duplicates Again</h3>



<p>Ever find yourself looking for a file — whether that’s a report or a spreadsheet — and you end up searching for 15 minutes and you still couldn’t find the one you’re looking for? </p>



<p>Or what about that time where you couldn’t figure out which version is the real “final” version because there are dozens of files with the word “final” in the filename. </p>



<p>These frustrations are common in every organisation. And the easiest way to make sure you find what you’re looking for and not waste your time searching over and over is to use a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">shared cloud storage</a> for all your files and documents. </p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>If you want to remain competitive and relevant in your industry, you have to accept the reality that status quo isn’t acceptable. </p>



<p>The market is always changing. That’s why you should also be changing. </p>



<p>If you don’t do something, you will get left behind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cloud-solutions/">cloud</a> isn’t just for purely technology-focused organisations, it’s for every business and it might just offer functionalities that you hadn’t considered for your company.</p>



<p>But before we move onto the advantages of cloud computing, let us quickly explain what it actually is. In a nutshell, it is a place where your data, as well as all online aspects of your business, can be stored securely – and it doesn’t need you to manage or maintain it. It is also pretty much infinite in size, so you never have to worry about running out of space.</p>



<h2>7 Advantages of Cloud Computing</h2>



<h3>1. Flexibility</h3>



<p>As mentioned in a previous article, having the ability to scale bandwidth when required is an extremely valuable&nbsp;resource to have as a part of your business strategy.</p>



<h3>2. Cost reduction</h3>



<p>Cloud computing allows a business to reduce spend on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure/">technology infrastructure</a> and capital cost expenditure, so of course that is an advantage for any business.</p>



<h3>3. Improves accessibility</h3>



<p>When it comes to providing work-from-anywhere access having cloud computing means employees are able to retrieve all the same systems as if they were in the office.</p>



<h3>4. Monitor projects more effectively</h3>



<p>With data and/or project information held in a location that is accessible to all appropriate employees, it is easier to get a quick, accurate picture of work flows – particularly since updates and changes are in real-time.</p>



<h3>5. Process big data</h3>



<p>In an earlier post, we discussed the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-is-big-data-and-how-does-an-it-company-assist-your-business-to-process-it/" target="_blank">value of big data for your business</a>, but without the use of cloud computing, it would be extremely difficult (and costly) to capture and store the information required to process your big data.</p>



<h3>6. Easy recovery</h3>



<p>Disasters happen, things go wrong and every business is at risk of virus’ wiping important data and information – but by working in the cloud, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protecting-critical-data-in-your-business/">data recovery</a> is quick and easy.</p>



<h3>7. Document control</h3>



<p>With a central storage point for documents, silos of information are no longer an issue, and it allows those&nbsp;responsible for document control to have complete visibility over all relevant data.</p>



<p>The list above is by no means exhaustive on the benefits of working in the cloud. And the fact is, it’s where businesses are going, so if you’re not there now, no doubt you will need to be in five years time to ensure your capabilities meet the expectations of your employees, clients and customers.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of moving your business information into <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/7-advantages-of-cloud-computing/">online Cloud storage</a>, note not all clouds are the same. It&#8217;s important you do a little checking to ensure your business data is safe.</p>



<h2>7 Things to Consider Before Moving Your Business Data to the Cloud</h2>



<h3 class="p2">1. Someone Else Has It</h3>



<p class="p2">Using Cloud storage means you don’t have to buy costly server equipment, store it and maintain it. It’s easy and efficient to use someone else’s technology.</p>



<p class="p2">That does mean someone else has control.</p>



<p class="p2">Some Cloud providers include file encryption, or you can use your own to add extra security, but that risk is always there.</p>



<h3 class="p2">2. No Standardisation</h3>



<p class="p1">Every Cloud provider offers something different. There are no laws or regulations around this service, which can make comparing companies difficult. It’s best to do some background checking before deciding on one and uploading all your files.</p>



<h3 class="p2">3. Lack of Support</h3>



<p class="p1">What happens if you need help? If you’re a paying customer a help line is only a call away, but that may not be the case if you’re using free software. Again, check reviews of the Cloud provider to see what their support system is like to avoid nasty surprises.</p>



<h3 class="p2">4. Cyber Attacks</h3>



<p class="p2">If it’s connected to the internet, then it is vulnerable. In 2014, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/icloud-hacking-not-just-for-celebrities/">hackers broke into the Apple Cloud accounts of a number of celebrities</a>, releasing their sensitive photos. Make sure whoever you choose to trust your company information with has comprehensive security measures to keep your data safe.</p>



<h3 class="p2">5. Liability</h3>



<p class="p2">If your data is breached, what happens? Does the fault lie with you or the Cloud owner? Some companies provide <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-insurance/">cyber security insurance</a> in case your data is hacked and released online.</p>



<p class="p2">Compensation is often limited, so it pays to check the fine print of your user contract.</p>



<h3 class="p2">6. Outages</h3>



<p class="p2">When you control your own server, most of the time you know what’s happening. When a Cloud storage system goes down, you won’t know until you try and access it.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/heres-why-microsoft-azure-faced-a-global-outage-yesterday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/infrastructure-as-a-service/amazon-disruption-produces-cloud-outage-spiral/d/d-id/1322279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>,&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/dropbox-outage,news-30270.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropbox</a>&nbsp;cloud systems have had outages.</p>



<p class="p2">You can’t know how long the problem will last,&nbsp; or control what’s happening. Thankfully in those instances backups kicked in and no major data was lost.</p>



<h3 class="p1">7. Shared Storage</h3>



<p class="p1">Unless your Cloud provider can guarantee your company will have a sole server, you’ll probably be sharing with another business. That’s just the nature of public technology. If a virus manages to infect one business, it can possibly spread to other businesses on that Cloud system.</p>



<p class="p2">Yes, there are risks to using the Cloud to store your data. That doesn’t mean it’s not safe or you shouldn’t do it. You risk your computer, laptop, tablet or phone every time you use the internet, but that doesn’t mean you’re going to stop going online!</p>



<p class="p2">Cloud companies are getting stronger every day as the technology develops, boosting security and providing more transparency to users. Whoever you sign up with, do your research beforehand, and always <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">keep your own backup copy</a>, just in case.</p>

<p>Computer technology is ever-evolving. From storing information on personal computers, servers and the web, the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cloud-solutions/">cloud</a> marks the latest technological milestone.</p>



<p class="p1">Businesses can host and share secure documents through cloud-based online storage while expanding their ability to cost-effectively meet computing resource demands.</p>



<h2 class="p2">Top 5 Benefits of the Cloud</h2>



<h3 class="p2">1. Cost-effective</h3>



<p class="p2">Using the cloud you pay only for the computing resources you use, rather than pre‐purchasing space and server equipment you may not need.</p>



<p class="p2">Eliminating the use of servers, in turn, reduces the need for storage space.</p>



<div class="toc">
<Strong>See Related:</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud/"> How Good Seed Trust (non-profit) Migrated 100% to the Cloud, Eliminated Server Issues, and Increased Productivity</a></div>



<h3 class="p2">2. Speed of Access</h3>



<p class="p2">The speed of some servers and internal systems slows down the further you are away from them, which isn’t great if you need files on the go. </p>



<p class="p2">Distance isn’t an issue with cloud storage. The faster you get your hands on the information, the more efficiently your business runs.</p>



<h3 class="p2">3. Flexibility of space needed</h3>



<p class="p2">Business’ workloads can scale up or down regularly, and the cloud’s capacity can adapt with you without the hassle of extra equipment.</p>



<h3 class="p2">4. Easy IT Management</h3>



<p class="p2">By taking out the manpower needed to run a complex internal IT function and replacing it with a user-friendly platform, business owners can focus on key goals. The cloud service offers a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/7-advantages-of-cloud-computing/">standardised platform</a> that allows for easy upgrades when needed.</p>



<h3 class="p2">5. Environmentally Friendly</h3>



<p class="p2">A paperless cloud system uses fewer resources than a server-centric system. Your carbon footprint is smaller and more environmentally friendly.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>It’s important to be forward thinking and to take us into the  21st century. Good systems, less paper, less files and folders is part  of that.</strong></p><cite>Grace Ikiua, CEO, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud/">Good Seed Trust</a></cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="p2">Risks of Using the Cloud</h2>



<p class="p1">Cloud systems are <strong>not immune</strong> from data leaks or cyber attacks, but neither are servers or network storage. It’s estimated cyber crime costs businesses $400 billion worldwide, not to mention the lost earnings that come from virus attacks, lost data and crashed systems.</p>



<p class="p1">Unfortunately, the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/which-employees-are-your-biggest-security-risk/">biggest security risk</a> to your business comes from within, especially the <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/">top leaders in your organisation</a>. </p>



<p class="p1">All it takes to get inside your network is a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">weak password</a> or an <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">employee innocently clicking on a line on an email</a>.</p>



<h4 class="p2"><strong>Before moving to the cloud, it is important that you:</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Assess all risks, create an inventory, and determine the potential outcome to your business</li><li>Determine the likelihood of these risks occurring and the residual risk it may have on your clientele.</li><li><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: inherit;">Consider your likely responses to these risks and create a plan of action.</span></li></ul>



<p class="p2">Your plan of action has to include both the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">technical and human elements</a>.</p>



<p class="p2">One technical solution is choosing infrastructures that incorporate security &#8211; rather than trying to add it to an existing legacy system. Often organisations focus on “making the walls higher.”</p>



<p class="p2">These “higher walls” could include numbers of firewalls — which in turn will result in an increase in log files and alerts. None of this guaranteed to prevent attacks ‐ especially if the danger is let in.</p>



<p class="p2">This is why it’s important to train your staff to understand threats and keep up with the latest cyber attack methods.</p>



<p class="p2">It takes technology, processes and people working together to protect your cloud storage system and effectively counter cyber threats.</p>
