<p>Data is one of the most valuable assets a business owns &#8211; it is the very essence of what an organisation is.</p>



<p>So what happens if one day it all just disappeared? It can, and does happen, but the thing is, it doesn’t have to end being a disaster for you and your business if your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">data isn&#8217;t backed-up correctly</a>.</p>



<h2>3 Ways to Check if Your Business Data is Backed Up Correctly</h2>



<h3>1. Use the Cloud</h3>



<p>Using the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cloud-solutions/">Cloud</a> for backing up your data is one of the most cost-effective, efficient ways available. And as mentioned previously, it can expand, and then retract in size, to meet the needs of your business.</p>



<p>How regularly is it backed up?</p>



<p>Is your data backed-up on a daily or weekly basis? Is it a full back up, or just incremental, where it only covers the most recently made changes? </p>



<p>These are important questions to know the answers to, whether you do it in-house, or have an external resource that looks after the backing-up of your data.</p>



<p>Read more:<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Poor IT will cost a business significantly &#8211; here&#8217;s how to do it the right way</a></p>



<h3>2. Check it’s actually working!</h3>



<p>A lot of businesses are confident in the fact that they back-up their data, but it is a very common occurrence that it isn’t done correctly – which is only discovered after there is a need to access it (usually after a loss). </p>



<p>So it is best that on a regular basis, you are checking that all your data is actually being backed-up completely and without issues.</p>



<h3>3. A disaster recovery plan is not enough</h3>



<p>Why not? Because a disaster recovery plan is only half of the solution when there is a loss of data. </p>



<p>Consider the example of a natural disaster, there is the team who go in and take care of the immediate risks and provide services to those affected – but after a week or a month, there is the requirement to then get everyone back into ‘business-as-usual’, where life needs to go back to how it was before the disaster.</p>



<p>How long does it take for you to get back to &#8220;business-as-usual&#8221; after if a disaster strikes? </p>



<p>If your answer is more than a week, then you have a lot of improvements to make. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 3-2-1 rule is a widely used technique for <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/backups/">backing up information</a>. The basic premise of this rule is to save three copies of your data – two on different media (for example, two different external hard drives), and one off-site (for example, in your company warehouse).</p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you have three copies of your data, then the risk of losing them all is very small. Although it may seem slightly cumbersome and over-the-top, it will give you peace of mind that no matter what happens, you won’t lose years of hard work.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept was created by Peter Krogh, an American photographer. In an article for dpbestflow.org Mr Krogh <a href="https://dpbestflow.org/node/262" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">wrote</span></a> that there are two types of people in the world: “those who have had hard drive failure, and those who will.”</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other words, hard drive failure is inevitable, so you might as well protect yourself as best you can.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr Krogh also wrote extensively about some of the circumstances that could lead to data loss, such as security threats, device failure, malicious damage, viruses, device glitches, and even lightning strikes/voltage surges.</span></p>



<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, he provides guidance on how to manage backups – for example, what to keep and what to let go. We’ve summarised some of his key points below.</span></p>



<h2>4 Key Points in Managing Your Backups</h2>



<h3><span class="s1">1. Identify your primary copy</span></h3>



<p><span class="s1">You might have copies of the same file saved in several places. </span></p>



<p><span class="s1">Identify the primary copy – this is what you will backup.</span></p>



<h3><span class="s1">2. Physically separate your backups</span></h3>



<p><span class="s1">A key component of the 3-2-1 rule is to make sure <strong>at least one of your backups is stored offsite</strong>, so your files will be protected in the event of a natural disaster.</span></p>



<h3><span class="s1">3. Implement rolling backups</span></h3>



<p><span class="s1">Create a system that offers automatic backups, so you never go an extended period of time between backups (the longer you go, the more data that’s exposed).&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3><span class="s1">4. Conduct a trial restoration</span></h3>



<p><span class="s1">You won’t know that a backup works until it comes time to test it. Try to <strong>test your backup systems before disaster strikes</strong>, so you know for sure that they work.</span></p>



<p class="p2">The 3-2-1 rule is so well-respected that it’s employed by the US government – or at least, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="s2">this article</span></a>.</p>



<p class="p2">“There is no such thing as a perfect backup system, but the 3-2-1 approach is a great start for the majority of people and businesses,” the article reads.</p>



<p class="p2">“Even the United States Government recommends this approach. In a 2012 paper for US-CERT (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team), Carnegie Mellon recommended the 3-2-1 method in their publication titled: Data Backup Options.”</p>



<p class="p2">We can learn a lot from the 3-2-1 rule and Mr Krogh. It takes a comprehensive and logical approach to data loss and security and puts much of the power back in our own hands.</p>



<p class="p2">With technology evolving at such a rapid pace, it can be tempting to tend towards apathy or overwhelm. Instead, the 3-2-1 rule is methodical and rational – something we should all aspire towards in our own cyber security strategies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All businesses rely on information. Some of it is more sensitive than others, and needs to stay that way if your&nbsp;business wants any success in the marketplace.</p>



<p>So, how can you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">protect your critical information</a> while still being able to do business?</p>



<h2>4 Ways to Protect Your Business Data</h2>



<h3>1. Encryption</h3>



<p>Cryptography is nothing new. Far from it. It’s thought the Egyptians invented it around 1900 BCE to make stories about their pharaohs seem even more mystical. Forms of encryption have been used ever since to protect sensitive data and turn the tides of war.</p>



<p>As encryption technology and methods advance, so do levels of code-breaking, which pushes the drive for more complex algorithms.</p>



<p>Encryption tools on your computer <strong>scramble data</strong> sent over a network, so anyone intercepting your emails won’t be able to read or download files. Only the intended person with the right decryption key will be allowed access. You can also encrypt files as you save them on your server or cloud. Even if someone hacks in, without the proper key the files will be useless to them.</p>



<p>This is also the same technology in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/ransomware-attacks-are-real-is-your-business-safe/">ransomware</a> &#8212; hackers encrypt your files so you can&#8217;t access them. You need to pay them to send you the decryption key, which will then unlock your files.</p>



<p>As encryption methods get more complex, providers have started building encoding tools into more products to make them simpler for people to use.</p>



<h3>2. Back-Ups</h3>



<p>Never keep all your eggs in one basket. If all of your business’ data, client information and financial records are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">stored in the one place,</a> you’re in trouble. </p>



<p>If something affects that computer, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/iot-network-and-endpoint-security-challenges/">network</a>, server or hard drive you have virtually no way to recover. It’s essential to have a regular back-up to protect your business in the event of disaster.</p>



<p>If the worst happens, with <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">regular back-ups</a> you have all your critical data stored somewhere else, and it won’t take too long to get your business back up and running.</p>



<h3>3. The Cloud</h3>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/enabling-safer-cloud-use-in-business/">Hosted cloud storage</a> is a very secure way of protecting your company data if you choose the right provider. Instead of a back-up server at your business, cloud storage saves data on an online server you can access through the internet.</p>



<p>It’s their responsibility to maintain security, updates, and business continuity, and you get the added bonus of off-site storage and good accessibility.</p>



<p>Larger cloud providers are more likely to have <strong>advanced security measures</strong> than most SME’s, and as their reputation is on the line they’re more security conscious than most when it comes to protecting data.</p>



<h3>4. The 3-2-1 Rule</h3>



<p>It might sound extreme, but it’s better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. To truly protect your company data you need <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">three back-up copies, two saved on different media and one stored off-site</a>.</p>



<p>For example, a back‐up hard drive in the office, a back-up server in your warehouse, and a back-up cloud server. Following the 3-2-1 rule protects your business from any single point of failure. </p>



<p>If your company’s national head office or data centre is in Christchurch, you want to make sure the off-site storage is out of Canterbury in case another earthquake knocks out infrastructure</p>
