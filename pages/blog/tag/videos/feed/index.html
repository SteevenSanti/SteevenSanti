<p>Let’s face it. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> isn’t the sexiest topic out there. But, as we rely on the internet more each day — our phones, computers, and other appliances at home and work — you cannot take online security for granted. </p>



<p>That’s why we curated the best videos we can find on cyber security which are at the same time, not boring. </p>



<h2>4 Cyber Security Videos That Are Not Boring</h2>



<h3>1. How cyber security would look like in real life</h3>



<p>When people think cyber security, they often don’t associate it being in the “real world.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s only on the internet, right? It can’t affect me.</p></blockquote>



<p>That’s why it is often difficult to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">understand what these terms are and what they mean</a>. </p>



<p>Watch this video to find out how cyber security would look like in real life…</p>

<h3>2. Are your passwords secure? </h3>



<p>“What’s the password to your email”</p>



<p>“Not even a clue? Is it a combination of your birthday? Does it have your pet’s name on it? Great. </p>



<p>“When’s your birthday? What’s the name of your pet? </p>



<p>“Thanks. So, I now have your email password…</p>



<p>Watch this funny video to see how people willingly give out their passwords to strangers on the street. </p>

<p>But kidding aside, you should seriously consider using strong and unique passwords and multi-factor authentication. Want to learn more? Join our 4-day email series on how to do that exactly. </p>

<h3>3. Theft in the 21th century</h3>



<p>You’ve bought a brand new and sophisticated car. You’ve installed CCTV cameras and home security software. </p>



<p>You’re safe from robbers, right? </p>

<h3>4. Cyber security starts at the top</h3>



<p>Ready to take cyber security seriously? </p>



<p>As with every implementation, cyber security has to start at the top! </p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6523545851179134976?compact=1" allowfullscreen="" width="504" height="284" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Cyber security is real. Cyber criminals are real. And it’s no longer confined to the “internet.” <br>As technology improves and permeates our everyday lives, it’s best to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">stop treating cyber risk as a separate type of risk</a>. </p>
