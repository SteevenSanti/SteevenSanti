<p>Is your business still running on Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2? Or maybe even Windows SQL 2008? If you are, you’re putting your business and your data at great risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you probably already know, using outdated software has a lot of risks associated with it. While the mantra of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” sounds reasonable, that only works if nothing is really broken. But in this case, Microsoft is officially ending its support for the software.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7fr2CtmaVmI" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<h2>What End of Support Means for Your Business</h2>



<p>If you’re still using these operating systems on your servers, it’s imperative that you remember these important dates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On&nbsp;<strong>January 14, 2020</strong>, Microsoft will end their support for both Windows Server 2008 and R2. And if you’re still using Window SQL 2008, Microsoft already ended their support last&nbsp;<strong>July 2019</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>End of Support (EOS) often means that the technology has lived its useful life. That means new, better, and often less expensive technology is available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s world, using outdated technology means you can’t quickly adapt to changes in the market nor serve our customers exceptionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is important because without support from Microsoft, that means you won’t be receiving any security updates from them. And that puts your entire business at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Problem or Opportunity</h3>



<p>You can take a look at this end of support from two different perspectives and why you should use this time to modernise your business and migrate to Azure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, it’s a way for you to avoid security breaches and compliance issues in the future. It’s also a way to lower your costs as maintaining these old/legacy technologies is going to be more expensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As their name implies, these operating systems came out in 2008. As you already know, 10 years (or more) is a very long time in the technology world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just take a look at how often big tech consumer brands introduce new products. Every single year, these brands hold events and unveil the latest technological developments they have made in the past year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung — all of them made introducing new products and services yearly that it has become a widely anticipated event.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2008 Was Over a Decade Ago</h3>



<p>To give you an idea of how far along we’ve come, below are some of the most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/12/top-technology-breakthroughs-of-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-known technological breakthroughs in 2008</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>USB 3.0</li><li>Apple’s App Store</li><li>Android</li><li>Flash memory/flash drives</li><li>GPS on mobile devices</li></ol>



<p>Today, these technologies are the standard or have already been replaced by newer versions (like USB 4.0).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 2008, on-premise and upfront licensing costs were still the norm. If you want to get a server, you’d have to pay for it upfront. If you want to buy a&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-365/">Microsoft Office</a>&nbsp;license for your computers, you’d have to buy the licenses upfront.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cloud-solutions/">cloud</a>&nbsp;and pay-as-you-use models are more prevalent. Most options provide you a monthly payment scheme that scales up or down depending on your usage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Future Proof Your Business</h3>



<p>Another way to look at this is to use this event to propel your organisation into the future. By&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/futureproof/">updating the technology</a>&nbsp;you use in your business, you’re keeping up with the times and joining the digital transformation revolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital transformation means&nbsp;<strong>relying less&nbsp;</strong>on on-premise, user-owned devices to a cloud-based one. This allows you to save up on costs and helps you with scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What Are My Options As a Business</h2>



<p>With the end of support coming soon, your business really has three options:</p>



<ol><li>100% cloud migration</li><li>Hybrid configuration&nbsp;</li><li>Status quo</li></ol>



<p>If you don’t know which option you should take, we’ll help you determine the best one for your specific situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From our experience, most businesses will benefit greatly from option 1. Some will be best suited for option 2. However, doing nothing (option 3) especially with the end of support coming soon is definitely is not an option you can choose.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Over to you</h2>



<p>IT is no longer a cost centre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In modern and successful businesses in New Zealand and all around the world, IT is treated as a business partner, as an enabler of the workforce. It’s one of the critical departments you need in order to create a strong competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are still using Windows Server 2008/R8, or even if you don’t know what you’re using but want to transform your business, let us know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can <a href="tel:09 916 1180">call us directly</a> or fill out the form below and someone from our team will reach out to you.&nbsp;</p>



<script async="" data-uid="a64123eca9" src="https://it360-limited.ck.page/a64123eca9/index.js"></script>



<p>Even if you don’t know what option is the best one to take for your business, we’ll help you figure it out. The important part is you take a step towards protecting your business and securing your future.</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud/">Good Seed Trust</a>, a non-profit organization, were experiencing issues with their legacy systems. This resulted to inefficiencies and productivity loss in the entire organization. But, after migrating to the cloud, their productivity went up, become more mobile, and saved over $40,000 in IT costs. </p>



<p>Watch the interview with Grace Ikiua, CEO of Good Seed Trust, to learn how we migrated the entire business to the cloud.</p>

<h2>Good Seed Trust Background</h2>



<p>Grace starts off the interview by sharing more about the history of Good Seed Trust. </p>



<p>“​I was on the Management Board of an early childhood centre that my friend had started in that 1980s and in 2006 the church offered it to us. So we formed Good Seed Trust.”</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re a non for profit, and the purpose of it is we want to build family hubs that strengthen families so that they can strengthen their community. So we&#8217;ve got 45 staff and we actually have five different sites because we don&#8217;t just do early childhood.”</p>



<p>“We have a wraparound service. We offer different programs that the parents have sort of asked for. We provide transport with family engagement workers. So we have one-on-one family coaching available.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img width="2048" height="1536" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/karleen-and-Children.jpg" alt="karleen and Children" class="wp-image-5620" title="How We Enabled the Good Seed Trust to Improve Staff Performance and Protect the Business 1"></figure></div>



<h2>The State of SMBs in New Zealand</h2>



<p>Dave Wilson, General Manager of iT360, shares his assessment of Good Seed Trust’ business environment. </p>



<p>“​The technology we found here at Good Seed Trust wasn&#8217;t unlike too many other businesses really. Windows computers that are just pieced together, trying to hang on.” </p>



<p>Legacy systems like on-premise servers are prevalent in New Zealand businesses. And while there’s nothing wrong with them, oftentimes, business owners think that it’s still the most effective way to run their business. </p>



<p>But, as most people who experienced working with on-premise servers, the moment these fill up with documents or as time goes by, they become inefficient. They’re not as fast as they used to. </p>



<p>Stefan Venter, iT360’s Business Development Manager said, “There&#8217;s older documents lying here. Someone saved it elsewhere and it all just turned into custard.” </p>



<p>“With the server, if you were at one of our remote sites, like in Otahu, it took 10 minutes to upload a photo. Often it crashed. It just wasn&#8217;t working,” Grace recalls. </p>



<p>As additional background, one of the tasks of the staff is to create storybooks. These are given periodically to the parents to keep them posted on the progress of their children. </p>



<p>This involves uploading/downloading photos for all the children periodically. If it takes you over 10 minutes just to <em>process</em> a single photo, imagine how much time it would take to do that for 20 kids? </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It means that for people like myself, we can work anywhere…I’m loving it.</p><cite>Grace Ikiua, CEO</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Moving to the Cloud 100%</h2>



<p>“This is presented a wonderful opportunity for us to say, look, ‘why don&#8217;t we completely transform the IT here and move this to the cloud,’” Dave said. </p>



<p>“Microsoft cloud platform gives so many benefits to small businesses like Good Seed. Its security, its platform; it&#8217;s a tight ecosystem. It&#8217;s like no other.“</p>



<p>Introducing change to any organization will be met by friction. That’s why when we work on any project, we do it in phases. </p>



<p>“So we recommended, firstly, Azure to replace the server. Sharepoint to replace the documents. Exchange online for the email. And the last thing was Teams for the team collaboration.”</p>



<p>This was what we presented to Grace. We shared the benefits, explained the tools, what’s involved, and how Good Seed Trust can benefit from migrating to the cloud. </p>



<p>As a non-technical decision maker, Grace needed to understand how the <em>new technology</em> will affect them, “and so I knew when iT360 started talking about what we could do, I knew what was possible.” </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img width="2560" height="1440" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/39981514_288893961900219_7486302703312699392_n.jpg" alt="39981514 288893961900219 7486302703312699392 n" class="wp-image-5622" title="How We Enabled the Good Seed Trust to Improve Staff Performance and Protect the Business 2"></figure></div>



<h2>Good Seed Trust Today After a Year of Migration</h2>



<p>“The cloud migration totally transformed the way that the business works, the way that people collaborate,” Dave said. </p>



<p>Stefan also shared how the staff are using the technology. </p>



<p>“Sharepoint also made document management, very easy versioning. Everyone knew exactly where the documentation was. If it needed updating, they know exactly where to go. There was no duplicates, none of that.”</p>



<p>One of the biggest benefit that the cloud offers is it gives the organization mobility. As you know, there’s a rise in telecommuting and the mobile workforce. The cloud is an integral part of capability. </p>



<p>“​It means that for people like myself, we can work anywhere…I’m loving it” </p>



<p>Grace also shares an example of a routine task they do. What used to take them over a week, now just take them less than two days to complete. Everything was just much streamlined and easier for everybody. </p>



<p>“We have an accounts person offsite, and she sees us our monthly reconciliation and we used to have like six versions of that floating around and emailing and coming back and now we have the document loaded in sharepoint. Everyone just goes into the one document, adds their bit, and we send that to her. That takes two days where that would usually take over a week.”</p>



<h2>Managing Change</h2>



<p>Technology is only useful if people use it. You may have the best equipment out there, but if you and your staff isn’t using it, it would just be an expensive purchase. </p>



<p>Dave shares how we manage change and make sure the staff will really adapt the technology. ​“Yeah, so managing change within a business is always difficult. To do that, we held workshops with the staff and we got people to really accept the tools, before we made the decision to move to the platform.”</p>



<p>“​They came in and did a meeting with our leaders and the biggest thing is just getting people who are not very confident with IT and moving them to a place with they&#8217;re confident,” says Grace. </p>



<p>Stefan shared something really important when it comes to adopting new technologies, “For us to really get people invested in a new solution is really to explain to them how it&#8217;s going to solve a problem.” </p>



<p> In business, one of the most common problems is that of communication especially for off-site staff — whether they’re located in another office or traveling — collaborating with them is a challenge. And that’s where the right technology will help ease this burden. </p>



<p>“Microsoft teams was really just collaboration, so how are we gonna fix the traveling? How are we going to fix not being able to get in touch with people?” </p>



<p>When asked about her assessment of iT360’s approach to managing change and introducing the new technologies, Grace says “​I think as they start to see the usefulness of it, they just buy into it more.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img width="2560" height="1707" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_2091.jpg" alt="IMG 2091" class="wp-image-5621" title="How We Enabled the Good Seed Trust to Improve Staff Performance and Protect the Business 3"></figure></div>



<h2>Front and Centre, Not Behind the Scenes</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, technology is only useful if it’s implemented and used by people. That’s why we conduct workshops and interview key stakeholders prior to implementing something new. Dave shares his thoughts on this. </p>



<p>“There&#8217;s this kind of stigma on IT guys being in the back office, but we choose to be front right and centre, because ultimately technology these days needs to be adopted by people and the way you do that is by having that very personal relationship.” </p>



<h2>Relationships </h2>



<p>“And I think the biggest thing for me is they treat you like part of the family, not just like as a customer. And I trust them implicitly that they&#8217;re going to do the best for us.”</p>



<p>“They understand our cost restraints, and they always would look at it a best cost value for us, not for them.”</p>



<h2>Onwards and Upwards: What Good Seed Trust Is Planning  Next</h2>



<p>​“Well what we&#8217;re looking at doing is using Teams next. It&#8217;s all been loaded on the computers and we&#8217;ll start training people and just make more time efficient, and we want to be up in the 21st century and using things to make us more efficient and alongside that we&#8217;re looking at going paperless,” Grace shares. </p>



<p>When asked about the entire project, Dave says “it’s absolutely thrilling to see when customers adopt the technology that we&#8217;re so passionate about. And it&#8217;s been the best thing to see Good Seed Trust change and transform and ultimately we know are a small part to play in the improvement of learning outcomes for the children here.” </p>

<p>In your life, when have you seen the most movement and success?</p>



<p>It certainly wasn’t when you got too comfortable and watched the World pass by! So why do so many companies decide to sit back when it comes to their IT?</p>



<p>IT is one of the world’s most evolving industries, yet it is still so difficult for IT Companies to convince their clients that the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure/">future of IT Infrastructure</a> is bright.</p>



<p>Each company has their reason for sticking with their legacy technology, and there are always arguments to stop you from moving on, but why not open your mind. Move away from what you’re comfortable with and try <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/office-365/">Office 365</a>.</p>



<p>Who knows, it might be exactly what you need to blast your business’s efficiency and success forward. Take a look at what we’re talking about!</p>



<h2>10 Benefits of Using Office 365</h2>

<p>And of course, if you’re a one step at a time kind of Company, then Office 365 has the ability to connect and integrate with your onsite technology as well.</p>



<h3>4. Access your Secured Data Anywhere in the World</h3>



<p>Yes, you heard right! You can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/7-advantages-of-cloud-computing/">access your data anywhere</a> in the world, and with any device. How incredible is that!
