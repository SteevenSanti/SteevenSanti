<p>Every layer of your business has a trophy target just waiting to get caught on the hacker’s hook. The best way you can protect them is to know the type of bait that the hacker will try to use and educate them on how to spot these threats when they cross their inbox.</p>



<p>Learn more about the Top 5 Trophy Targets in your organization and the bait hackers will use against them.</p>



<h2><strong>TROPHY TARGET: CEO</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img width="300" height="130" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TROPHY-TARGET-CEO-300x130.png" alt="TROPHY TARGET CEO" class="wp-image-2494" title="Who Are Your Organisations Top Targets? 1"></figure>



<p>It’s easy enough for hackers to find information on a company. Just a quick search of the company page, or social media sites like LinkedIn, makes it easy for them to find the names and email addresses of members of finance or legal teams. A simple email with a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-threats-dont-let-lack-of-knowledge-hurt-your-business/">spoofed email address</a> from a clerk on the legal team and a subject line with the threat of a lawsuit is sure to make even a CEO click any link.</p>
