<p>Earlier last year, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> implemented a new network solution to improve their security architecture. As a solutions provider, we also partner with other companies who can supplement us with the services we need to  deliver value to our customers. </p>



<p>Enter Kordia. </p>



<p>Upon our recommendation, Farro partnered with Kordia to deploy a new wide area network (WAN). The project also included a new internet connectivity and a new phone system. Watch this interview as Brent La Franchie of Kordia and Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager of Farro Fresh, as they talk about the project. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_pvqi12mkpo videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Kordia Background</h2>



<p>Brent starts off by saying, “Kordia has been around for 70 years. Kordia is known for its broadcasting capabilities, that&#8217;s where our pedigree is, and that&#8217;s where we came from.” </p>



<p>He then emphasizes the relationship Kordia and iT360 has in the past. It’s a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/case-study-farro-fresh-focus-on-customers-instead-of-security-issues-causing-inefficiencies/">recurring theme</a> that we often emphasize ourselves. </p>



<p>“iT360 Kordia actually have some personal roots that go a long way back. Our fathers worked together back in the technology age, way back in the 80s and 90s. I&#8217;m extremely proud that I can work alongside someone who my father worked alongside. We&#8217;re both very passionate about what we do. Both share a lot of the same values and we are both driven to get the same outcomes for our customers.”</p>



<h2>Security Issues That Need to Be Addressed</h2>



<p>Simon starts off by describing the security issues they were experiencing at Farro. </p>



<p>“In late 2017, we had some security issues, and our CEO, Bryce Howard had worked with iT360.” </p>



<p>The security issues faced by Farro hundred them from doing their work. As noted by Simon in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/farro-fresh-protects-digital-technologies-using-watchguard/">another video</a>, nothing’s ever been compromised, but the incursions were preventing their staff to do their job properly. </p>



<p>He goes on to continue by sharing his impressions of us during the early stages of the relationship. </p>



<p>“There was an immediate level of confidence just from meeting with the guys and talking to them about what we wanted out of the relationship and what they could bring to the table.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Brent talks more about the solution and how it was implemented&#8230;</p>



<p>“So that solution was a new wide area network, Awareness we call it. New internet connectivity, new phone system, and also some new security architecture.”</p>



<p>“One of the clear directives was how do we transition them, to this new fantastic network, without disrupting their everyday business? So between iT360 and Kordia, we implemented a network, which sat alongside their existing network infrastructure. And then once ready, we cut that network over to the new network.” </p>



<p>While this may sound simple on the surface, this involved a lot of moving parts from three different parties. Despite this, the switch was successful and didn’t create any disturbance in the operations of Farro Fresh. </p>



<h2>The Results: Simon Looks Back at the Partnership</h2>



<p>“The choice IT360 had made to partner with Kordia for us was the right one,” said Simon. “And the expertise Kordia had available was phenomenal. Throughout the whole process, we always felt that we were listened to. And the focus of my job has changed from fire fighting and repair to planning and future projects.” </p>



<p>“If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.”</p>

<p>Information technology and running a business go hand-­in-­hand. Their interdependent nature has <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">changed the landscape of business</a> with the emergence of e­commerce, marketing through social media, and the way businesses <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/messenger-app-how-to-choose-for-your-business/">communicate</a> with their employees, clients and consumers.</p>



<p>In order to survive and adapt to all the e­-platforms have to offer, businesses have had to embrace information system management tools like customer relationship management systems (CRM), and supply chain management systems (SCM).</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-use-it-to-increase-business-profitability/">Businesses depend on IT </a>to run their CRMs and SCMs, and basically do business. If their network crashes, sometimes there’s nothing they can do.</p>



<p>Resilient IT infrastructure is needed to preempt and actively respond to business pressures from unexpected and anticipated issues. In the event of high customer demand, system failures, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber attacks</a> or power cuts, this infrastructure puts systems in place to cope with the effects of business life.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/which-employees-are-your-biggest-security-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Which employees are your biggest security risk?&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2>E-Business Infrastructure Basics</h2>



<p>Business infrastructure are basic facilities, structures, and services upon which the rest of a business is built. Your e-business infrastructure, or information technology infrastructure, is a&nbsp;set of information&nbsp;technology&nbsp;(IT) components that are the foundation of an IT service.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s composed of both physical components (such as computer and networking hardware, data centers, and other facilities) and also various software applications and network components (like cloud computing technology).</p>



<p>Depending on the size, industry, and business model, the technology infrastructure of businesses is unique to them.</p>



<p>Because business owners and leaders rely on IT to manage their organisation, it&#8217;s imperative that the entire IT infrastructure can handle both planned and unplanned disruptions.</p>



<h2>Plan for the Unexpected</h2>



<p>Any disruption to a business’ workflow, whether it’s positive or negative can result in a lack of productivity. </p>



<p>In today’s fast­-paced marketplace this can be more than a hiccup, rather the final heart attack that flatlines a business. </p>



<p>Hiccups can lead to any or all of the following:</p>



<ol><li>Loss of reputation </li><li>Loss of clientele</li><li>Decreasing the value of a business</li></ol>



<p>In order to avoid this domino effect, resilient infrastructure aims to limit the potential financial strain a business needs to acknowledge before responding and resolving the issue.</p>



<p>Not all business risks can be resolved, but some can be alleviated and managed. It is important to know a business’ systems capacity, so in the event of a crisis identifying and fixing the issue becomes easier. </p>



<p>One way to do this is to audit and evaluate business processes to see whether there are risks in the IT systems that support that function. </p>



<p>A Christchurch author was interviewed on TV3s Campbell Live, driving many viewers to the author’s website. The increased traffic crashed the website, halting online book orders and harming their business. The issue was fixed easily but could have been avoided if they had anticipated the web visitor increase.</p>



<h2>Plan for Everyday Scenarios</h2>



<p>Once your CRM and SCM systems are in place, that’s not the time to relax. You should always be looking for ways to streamline your operation. </p>



<p>It’s also a good idea to train multiple people to manage key roles, in case an employee leaves or isn’t there when a crisis hits. </p>



<p>The more people who know what to do in the event something goes wrong, the more resilient your business’ infrastructure will be.</p>



<p>If the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/farro-fresh-implements-new-network-solution-partners-with-kordia/">network crashes</a> and your tills go offline, or there’s a massive increase in demand and the line starts growing out the door? Do you have alternative ways of processing customer payments or will you have to turn business away?</p>



<p><strong>[Case Study]</strong>: <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh Implemented a New Network and Continues to Grow</a></p>



<p>Training staff and having back­up infrastructure in place will help your business cope. For common, everyday scenarios think of a few alternatives and how your business could work through them.</p>



<p>From the examples given above, it&#8217;s best to start with public-facing processes or those that could affect your customers. </p>



<p>Acknowledging the potential failures of systems and applications will help you to build resilient technology infrastructure. </p>



<p>As everyday business increasingly relies on IT infrastructure, it’s essential to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-threats-dont-let-lack-of-knowledge-hurt-your-business/">build a plan B</a> in order for your business to recover quickly and maintain productivity.</p>

<p>Whenever <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure/">IT infrastructure causes problems in a business, management is</a> often quick to consider only the impact on the company itself. But employees are also very much affected by IT issues, and it’s not in the way you’d think. </p>



<h2>5 Problems of Poor IT Infrastructure</h2>



<h3>1. Lack of control</h3>



<p>When IT issues affect a person’s work, they can often feel like they don’t have any control over their day. </p>



<p>Because technology problems get in the way of communication, production, output and task function, when these are interrupted on a regular basis – there is a loss of power over how efficiently and effectively work can be completed. </p>



<h3>2. Stress build-up</h3>



<p>Following on from point 1, if IT issues are a regular occurrence in the workplace, it is very likely that there will be a build-up of frustration, and ultimately stress from not being able to complete duties &#8211; and the flow-on effects arising from delays and disruptions to processes. </p>



<p>If an employee has to work late or increase their pace significantly when systems are back up and running, there will always be a risk of stress build-up. </p>



<h3>3. Losing traction</h3>



<p>When IT issues <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-it-issues-are-reducing-your-businesss-productivity/">interrupt a workflow</a>,  then losing traction is a very real problem. </p>



<p>For jobs which require concentration and focus, problems with the technology being used is extremely detrimental to output, whether due to delays with getting it restarted, or simply being constantly diverted off-task. </p>



<h3>4. Lack of belief in the business</h3>



<p>If a business or organisation has constant IT issues that aren’t dealt with correctly, employees may start to feel like their employer doesn’t care about providing them with the right technology to carry out their duties. </p>



<p>Of course, this isn’t always the case, but when someone wants to do the work they have been employed to do, it is hard to stay encouraged by an organisation that isn’t able to assist them with their tasks and responsibilities – you couldn’t be a very good bus driver if you were only given a bike! </p>

<h3>5. Loss of motivation</h3>



<p>When your employees aren’t able to work efficiently and effectively because of issues outside of your control, it can be hard to maintain a  certain level of motivation to get your work completed. They may think “why bother?” </p>



<p>Because it only results in them managing to keep things at an average level of completion.
