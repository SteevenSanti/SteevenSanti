<p>Earlier last year, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> implemented a new network solution to improve their security architecture. As a solutions provider, we also partner with other companies who can supplement us with the services we need to  deliver value to our customers. </p>



<p>Enter Kordia. </p>



<p>Upon our recommendation, Farro partnered with Kordia to deploy a new wide area network (WAN). The project also included a new internet connectivity and a new phone system. Watch this interview as Brent La Franchie of Kordia and Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager of Farro Fresh, as they talk about the project. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_pvqi12mkpo videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Kordia Background</h2>



<p>Brent starts off by saying, “Kordia has been around for 70 years. Kordia is known for its broadcasting capabilities, that&#8217;s where our pedigree is, and that&#8217;s where we came from.” </p>



<p>He then emphasizes the relationship Kordia and iT360 has in the past. It’s a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/case-study-farro-fresh-focus-on-customers-instead-of-security-issues-causing-inefficiencies/">recurring theme</a> that we often emphasize ourselves. </p>



<p>“iT360 Kordia actually have some personal roots that go a long way back. Our fathers worked together back in the technology age, way back in the 80s and 90s. I&#8217;m extremely proud that I can work alongside someone who my father worked alongside. We&#8217;re both very passionate about what we do. Both share a lot of the same values and we are both driven to get the same outcomes for our customers.”</p>



<h2>Security Issues That Need to Be Addressed</h2>



<p>Simon starts off by describing the security issues they were experiencing at Farro. </p>



<p>“In late 2017, we had some security issues, and our CEO, Bryce Howard had worked with iT360.” </p>



<p>The security issues faced by Farro hundred them from doing their work. As noted by Simon in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/farro-fresh-protects-digital-technologies-using-watchguard/">another video</a>, nothing’s ever been compromised, but the incursions were preventing their staff to do their job properly. </p>



<p>He goes on to continue by sharing his impressions of us during the early stages of the relationship. </p>



<p>“There was an immediate level of confidence just from meeting with the guys and talking to them about what we wanted out of the relationship and what they could bring to the table.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Brent talks more about the solution and how it was implemented&#8230;</p>



<p>“So that solution was a new wide area network, Awareness we call it. New internet connectivity, new phone system, and also some new security architecture.”</p>



<p>“One of the clear directives was how do we transition them, to this new fantastic network, without disrupting their everyday business? So between iT360 and Kordia, we implemented a network, which sat alongside their existing network infrastructure. And then once ready, we cut that network over to the new network.” </p>



<p>While this may sound simple on the surface, this involved a lot of moving parts from three different parties. Despite this, the switch was successful and didn’t create any disturbance in the operations of Farro Fresh. </p>



<h2>The Results: Simon Looks Back at the Partnership</h2>



<p>“The choice IT360 had made to partner with Kordia for us was the right one,” said Simon. “And the expertise Kordia had available was phenomenal. Throughout the whole process, we always felt that we were listened to. And the focus of my job has changed from fire fighting and repair to planning and future projects.” </p>



<p>“If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.”</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a>, a boutique supermarket chain, was experiencing security issues in their business. This prevented them from serving their customers fully. </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Earlier this year, we interviewed Bryce Howard, CEO of Farro Fresh, about the challenges they were facing and where they are now after working with us. </p>



<h2>Farro Fresh Background</h2>



<p>“So we&#8217;re a boutique supermarket chain that has been set up in Auckland starting about 2006. And starting from one store, small beginning, 10 people, and from there we&#8217;ve grown to six supermarkets, have about 350 full-timers, and we&#8217;re covering most of Auckland.”  </p>



<p>Bryce then goes to explain the importance of digital technology to their business&#8230;</p>



<p>“The digital technology for Farro is imperative for our business. We need a system that is both stable and operational seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and without that, we won&#8217;t have a business.” </p>



<p>And as is often the case with most New Zealand businesses, they don’t think about protecting their data and other information&#8230;until something happens. </p>



<p>“The security aspect is quite interesting. You don&#8217;t realize how important it is until you have an incursion. We&#8217;ve certainly learned the hard way, learned a couple of times that the security of the network is of utmost importance.”</p>



<p>In fact, that’s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">one of the most common myths</a> SMB owners came to believe in — “I’m a small business, no one would target me.” But as you may already know by now, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">most cyber attacks aren’t targeted</a>. </p>



<p>For example, the most common type of attack, email phishing, isn’t sent to a single person or a company. It’s sent to pretty much everyone in the cyber criminal’s database — which <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">most likely would include yours</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. </p><cite>Bryce Howard, CEO</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Importance of Relationships</h2>



<p>One of the feedback we often get from our customers is that we don’t treat them as clients; rather, treat them as family. But don’t just take our word for it. Check out our <a href="https://g.page/iT360" target="_blank">reviews on Google</a>.</p>



<p>David Wilson, iT360’s General Manager, talks about this relationship more. </p>



<p>“We came to work with Farro actually because of relationships. My father had been working with Bryce for many, many years back at Tasti Products, actually. He realized the situation of IT in the business at the time and reached out to us to help. Because of that relationship and the fact that Dad had built trust with Bryce over so many years, it just meant that Bryce could say to us, &#8220;I know you can take care of this job, and I trust you.&#8221; </p>



<h2>Systems Thinking vs Bandaid Solution</h2>



<p>We’ve been in the business for <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">over 25 years</a>. We’ve had our share of comments and feedback from various customers across different industries. </p>



<p>One of the most common issue we often hear is service providers (like us) often recommend solutions to fix the symptoms. And as you already know, targeting the symptoms vs the underlying solutions isn’t a good strategy. While it does seem ok in the short-term, eventually, this creates more problems for the business. </p>



<p>That’s why we always make sure we understand the situation fully before recommending something. </p>



<p>And that was the same thing with Farro. </p>



<p>Dave goes on to continue, “it was a business that actually needed something done in almost every area of IT, and we managed to achieve the entire project in a very, very short window of time, without impacting any operations.” </p>



<p>Recommending one thing might make the problem go away temporarily. But without a systemic approach, that problem will continue to rear its ugly head. </p>



<h2>Focus on Customers Instead of Internal Issues</h2>



<p>When asked about the results of working with iT360, Bryce said “For me, the key proof in the pudding is the fact that we don&#8217;t have to keep on thinking about the safety, security, or access of our computers.”</p>



<p>And that’s one of the criteria every supplier or vendor should be weighed against — do they allow you to focus on your core business instead of constantly putting out fires? Are the systems running and working the way they should? Or do these issues continue coming up? </p>



<p>Bryce continues, “We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. We&#8217;re continuing to have a great relationship and a great outcome from working with iT360.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Network monitoring is an essential expense for most businesses, but it’s important to research the different tools available so you don’t get ripped off. It&#8217;s also one of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">the crucial areas in cyber security</a> you need to have in place. </p>



<p>As your business grows, you will need to invest in more sophisticated tools to protect your technology and prevent it from falling. One of the most important tools to consider is <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/iot-network-and-endpoint-security-challenges/">network monitoring software</a>, which scans&nbsp;for problems – from frozen servers to&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">security threats</a>&nbsp;and everything in between. </p>



<p>The monitoring itself is automated with software or tools, and as soon as a problem is detected the network administrator (either yourself or your IT partner, depending on the size of your business) is notified.  </p>



<p>The sooner you find out there is a problem, the sooner you can take steps to find an appropriate solution. If your business is very small, it’s probably relatively easy to keep track of everything yourself. But as soon as you hire staff and employ multiple devices across a network, there’s a risk of missing important  IT reports and warnings. </p>



<p>Network monitoring gives you peace of mind that if there’s a problem, you will be notified. However, the cost of using network monitoring tools can be high. As a  budget-conscious business owner, how do you protect your network without spending a fortune? </p>



<h2>How do you protect your network without spending a fortune?</h2>



<p>The first step is to find a way to measure the return on investment (ROI).  </p>



<p>If you already have a network monitoring system in place, figure out whether it is saving you money and adding value to your business. The best way to measure ROI is to calculate the ‘time saved’ thanks to your&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">network monitoring</a>&nbsp;software. </p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li>How long would it have taken to identify and fix the problems without the software?</li><li>How would have this impacted staff productivity through downtime and network outages?</li><li>And how many support calls would you have had to make?</li></ul>



<p>Conducting this simple ROI exercise can help you see the value in network monitoring software, but you should still shop around to make sure you are getting the best deal for your business. </p>



<p>Do your due diligence and collect quotes from various network monitoring suppliers so you can compare the pros and cons of each one. </p>



<p>At iT360, we can recommend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-products/security-services/network-discovery?referral=it360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WatchGuard Network Discovery</a>&nbsp;tool.  Not only is this an affordable option, but it also comes with a simple 1-click integration function, meaning it can easily connect to other WatchGuard products such as firewalls and traffic monitoring tools. </p>



<p>Network monitoring is an expense – but like many expenses, the cost of not employing a solution across your network could be much higher. Business leaders need to realise that cyber&nbsp;security is a big <strong>deal.&nbsp;It affects&nbsp;reputation, internal communication and even company culture.&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">Download our free guide</a>&nbsp;to better understand</strong>.</p>
