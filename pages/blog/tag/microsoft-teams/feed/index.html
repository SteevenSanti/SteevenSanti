<p>Wondering how other organisations use <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>? Here are four interviews from different industry experts sharing how they use MS Teams and how it&#8217;s transforming the way they do business. </p>



<p>In this article, you&#8217;ll find 4 videos that cover specific topics. You can either watch the video, or read the write-up, or both. Enjoy! </p>



<h2>Get to Know the People in the Videos</h2>



<ul><li>Anthony McMahon, Chief Technologist, the <a href="https://vcto.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT Psychiatrist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janine-brittain-3ab119b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janine Brittain</a>, Microsoft Modern Workplace BDM, <a href="https://online.exeed.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exeed</a></li><li>Randy Chapman, Head of Consulting, <a href="https://www.enablit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enablit</a> and Microsoft AVP</li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-kelley-msft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Kelley</a>, Teams Customer Success Black Belt, Microsoft</li></ul>



<h2>Part 1: Focus on Solving Problems</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/1uychuo5z2.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_1uychuo5z2 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>One of the best ways to implement Microsoft Teams is to focus on a specific problem that it solves. You don&#8217;t need to dive into each individual feature. </p>



<p>Just answer the question &#8220;How is MS Teams going to help my business with ______?&#8221; Focus on problem instead. </p>



<ul><li><strong>You want to host a video call with several clients</strong>. Here&#8217;s how you do it. </li><li><strong>What about accessibility</strong>? Can I use it on any device? What if I switch from my work desktop computer to my mobile phone, to my home laptop? Yup, MS Teams got you covered. </li><li><strong>What about an unstable internet connection</strong>? MS Teams doesn&#8217;t need a perfect internet connection to run. </li></ul>



<h2>Part 2: Collaboration Made Easy</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/i56okw1amc.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_i56okw1amc popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>Microsoft calls Teams the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/work-better-implementing-hub-for-teamwork/">hub for teamwork</a>. If you aren&#8217;t using it for collaboration, you&#8217;re not using it right. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re tired of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/teams-vs-email-which-communication-medium-can-adapt-to-your-business-needs/">too many emails</a> and constant <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">storage and file issues</a>, then you will benefit greatly from using MS Teams. </p>



<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-buttons aligncenter">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-light-gray-color has-background has-vivid-red-background-color" style="border-radius:3px" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Access the Teams in 10 Days Videos</a></div>
</div>



<h2>Part 3: More Than Just Chat</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ipmkfxiqp8.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ipmkfxiqp8 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>How are you using MS Teams? Do you use it for chat and video calls? Good. That&#8217;s the most basic functionality. </p>



<p>Did you know you can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-ms-teams-for-internal-communication-5-different-options/">leave audio or voice notes</a> too? This is especially helpful if you&#8217;re on-the-go and want to send a message to someone quickly. </p>



<p>Have you tried recording your meeting? This is a great option for both internal and external uses. Internally, someone might not be able to make it to the meeting because of an emergency. With a single click of a button, you can record the entire meeting and it will be available to everyone in the channel. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a great way to record conversations with clients or other third party vendors. If you combine it with the whiteboard feature, or even just a regular meeting, this will be a very nice value-add. </p>



<p>What about trying to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-teams-integration-with-other-apps/">work on the same files together</a>? You know, those monthly reports you send out. Or that spreadsheet everyone needs to add their inputs to. Instead of sending out the files from one person to another, causing multiple file versions, you can work on the files together inside Microsoft Teams. </p>



<h2>Part 4: Rolling Out MS Teams</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/wm3ik5n445.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_wm3ik5n445 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>What&#8217;s the easiest way to roll out Microsoft Teams in your organisation? Show, don&#8217;t tell. </p>



<p>Demonstrate how easy it is to use different use cases. For example, one of the concerns of many during a virtual call is of privacy. MS Teams has a built-in function that, with a click of a button, blurs your entire background. This is perfect for work-from-home situations where you don&#8217;t want other meeting attendees to see what&#8217;s behind you. </p>



<p>One of the upsides of in-person meetings is the ability to illustrate what you&#8217;re trying to explain—whether that&#8217;s a diagram, a flowchart, or simply mapping out a concept. With MS Teams, there&#8217;s a feature called <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-whiteboard-in-microsoft-teams-7a6e7218-e9dc-4ccc-89aa-b1a0bb9c31ee?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whiteboard</a> where you can do that. Now, there&#8217;s a lower barrier to conducting meetings since you do not have to always prepare slides.  </p>



<p>If you need help implementing MS Teams in your organisation, fill-out the form below and someone from our team will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>One of the best features of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> is the ability to collaborate with your colleagues right from the app itself. </p>



<p>That’s right, there’s no need to send emails back-and-forth and run the risk of having 5 “final” versions of the same document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every organisation is different. The way you work is unique to you. But, there are certain apps/tools we use that might be similar. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/xpst7f5rre.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_xpst7f5rre popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<h2>3 Ways You Can Collaborate with Your Colleagues Using MS Teams</h2>



<p>We briefly mentioned this in another post and showed you an example of what it looks like with Asana connected. </p>



<p>Here, I’ll be sharing several examples but the process all starts the same. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="569" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch9_add_tab-1024x569.gif" alt="ch9 add tab" class="wp-image-7213" title="Microsoft Teams Integration with Other Apps 1"></figure>



<p>First, you head on over to the channel you want to add the app/file in. Click on the plus (+) icon to add another tab. You’ll be presented with several apps there. </p>



<p>If you can’t find the app you&#8217;re looking for, you can try searching for it here. </p>



<p>Select the app you want. You then set it up by giving MS Teams access to it (kind of like when you use an email client like Outlook and you want to access your Gmail accounts). </p>



<p>It’s from here where the process/steps deviate.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Project management — Asana</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="960" height="540" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch9_how_to_add_asana.gif" alt="ch9 how to add asana" class="wp-image-7219" title="Microsoft Teams Integration with Other Apps 2"></figure>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to add Asana an Asana Project to MS Teams.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Setup your project in Asana. Once you have your project setup, remember its name.&nbsp;</li><li>Go into the appropriate channel inside MS Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the plus (+) to add a new app&nbsp;</li><li>Select Asana</li><li>If this is your first time setting this up, you’ll be asked to login. If you already did this before, proceed to the next step.&nbsp;</li><li>Choose the correct organisation, if you are part of any.&nbsp;</li><li>Search for the project you want to import.&nbsp;</li><li>Click ‘save’</li><li>The Asana project you added will now be available as one of the tabs at the top of that channel.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Once you’ve done this, you can see the new tab added on that specific channel. You and your team can now manage this particular project without leaving MS Teams.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Tracking via spreadsheet — Excel</h3>



<p>Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to add an Excel file your team can collaborate together inside MS Teams. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1080" height="600" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch9_how_to_add_excel.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-7220" title="Microsoft Teams Integration with Other Apps 3"></figure>



<ol><li>Go into the appropriate channel inside MS Teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Click on the plus (+) to add a new app&nbsp;</li><li>Select Excel</li><li>Rename the tab</li><li>Locate the file you want to add. This may take a couple of clicks as you navigate around the folders.&nbsp;</li><li>Click ‘save’</li><li>The Excel file you added will now be available as one of the tabs at the top of that channel.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3>3. Working on a report — PowerPoint</h3>



<p>This process is very similar to the previous one (Excel). </p>



<p>Ever wondered how to eliminate the constant emailing back-and-forth of reports? You send one version, then Sally adds their revision, then sends it back not knowing John was also working on a few edits. </p>



<p>Now, you have three different file versions—an updated one from Sally and another from John. So, which one do you use? </p>



<p>The best way to reduce this confusion, save everyone time, and save a lot of emails and disk space, add it on to MS Teams and edit their in real-time together. </p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>Microsoft Teams calls itself as the hub for teamwork. And that’s true. In today’s world, companies no longer have the luxury to be inefficient and unproductive. Every tool that helps them overcome these challenges is definitely worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online meetings, virtual meetings, Zoom calls, virtual conferences—these have become the norm in our lives. When it comes to the professional setting, time matters a lot. That&#8217;s why making sure that your internet connection, audio and/or video settings are working properly sends a sign of professionalism. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>, here&#8217;s how you do it. </p>



<div margin:"auto"><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/h8eym6u7ce.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_h8eym6u7ce popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:601px">&nbsp;</span></div>



<p>A lot of people think that hopping on a call or any meeting (whether that&#8217;s in-person or online) is enough. What people don&#8217;t realize is that real professionals spend a few minutes preparing for the meeting. </p>



<p>Reviewing the agenda, taking a look at the previous notes and action items, and, in virtual meetings, testing their technology. </p>



<p>Testing your setup before any call is a great practice. </p>



<p>This is even more important if you constantly switch from multiple devices and equipment. For example, you use a laptop, desktop, and your phone to conduct calls. Then you also have your wireless and wired earphones. All-in-all, those are very different configurations. </p>



<p>Imagine this scenario. You have a scheduled call at 9:30 AM. You joined on the call on your phone and stepped away from your desk. You might think your wireless headphones will connect automatically to your phone, but since you used them last on your desktop, that&#8217;s where it connected. And now, 15 seconds into the call and audio is still coming from your desktop computer. You scramble to fix the connection. And now, right after fixing it, you explain what happened. A few minutes in and you still haven&#8217;t started talking about your agenda. </p>



<p>Take the time to test your internet and audio levels before every meeting. It&#8217;ll save you and the people you&#8217;re meeting with a lot of time. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In today’s world, we often have a plethora of available tools available for us to communicate with our friends, family, and colleagues in the workplace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this is very convenient, this availability of single-use tools or apps makes it very confusing and time-consuming whenever we need to find that conversation again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is very crucial, especially in the workplace. Imagine the inefficiency when you send an email back to your boss, customer, or colleague saying that you can’t find the data for the report they sent you last week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, I’ll share the different ways you can communicate inside MS Teams and how you can use them to tailor your communication and be more effective.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>5 Ways to Communicate Inside Microsoft Teams</h2>



<p>Have you ever thought about communication in general?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Think about the last time you sent a thank you card to someone you interviewed with in the mail, or a phone call to your spouse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communication, at its simplest definition, is made up of someone sending a message using a medium to someone else.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our analogy above, you’d see the different aspects in play:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Thank You Card<ul><li>You — the sender</li><li>Card — includes both the message and the medium</li><li>Interviewer — recipient&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Phone Call<ul><li>You — sender (and recipient)&nbsp;</li><li>Phone — medium</li><li>Conversation — message</li><li>Spouse — recipient (and sender)&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>At work, and life in general, we communicate with other people in a variety of ways. But, we often don’t think about the recipient and the best way to send our message across.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Communicating effectively means using a different medium depending on the person (or people) you’re talking to and the type of message you’re trying to convey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a short question or an update might do well in a written form, while a discussion on a topic or project will do better in a call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Microsoft Teams, you can use different types of medium to communicate more effectively and avoid misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Chat: 1-on-1 or group chats</h3>



<p>The most-used feature of Teams is chats. You can chat 1-on-1, or participate in group or team chats. It really depends on the topic or conversation.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you are working on a project with your team, or simply want to chat about relevant updates in the industry. There are 15 of you in the team. All topics and discussions about the project goes here. Everyone who is part of the channel gets to see and can participate in the chat.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="612" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch7_team_conversation-1024x612.png" alt="1 on 1 Chats inside MS Teams" class="wp-image-7206" title="Using MS Teams for Internal Communication: 5 Different Options 4"></figure>



<p>But if you’re requesting for a leave from your boss, that conversation might be better using a private or 1:1 chat.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Voice notes</h3>



<p>Sometimes, you’re on-the-go, or you’re doing something with your hands. Or simply want to send a quick update or message and don’t have time (or being lazy about it) to type on the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams offers the ability to leave voice notes/messages.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="750" height="1288" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch7_voice_memos.gif" alt="How to leave voice notes in MS Teams" class="wp-image-7208" title="Using MS Teams for Internal Communication: 5 Different Options 5"></figure>



<p>Just like chats, this can be sent to a person (private chat) or to a group.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Calls</h3>



<p>You already know that written messages can often be misinterpreted (and is often a big cause for misunderstandings). The main reason for this is written communication often lack an important part of communication like tone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, for conversations that require back-and-forth discussion, it’s best to get on a call. It’s easier, faster, and helps avoid miscommunication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While you can do this with your phone, why not take advantage of “free” calls inside Teams directly?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best part is you can also call people outside your organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. Video calls</h3>



<p>One of the best ways to meet with other people is face-to-face. No one can doubt that. Body language, or non-verbal communication, makes up over 50% of the communication and is lost on calls and chats and email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But because of the changing demands of work, it becomes necessary that we adapt as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s how video conferencing comes in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can meet with people who are across the globe, or at another location, or in the airport, as if we were meeting with them face-to-face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll learn more about this in the next chapter.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>5. Video recordings</h3>



<p>This last type of media available in MS Teams is often used for people who can’t attend a meeting with their colleagues. It’s a great way to catch up on what happened as if you were there too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you have a weekly recurring meeting with your team that discusses strategies, projects, and updates. For some reason, you have to be on a plane that exact time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone is busy and can’t reschedule.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="912" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch7_video_recording-1024x912.png" alt="video recordings in MS Teams" class="wp-image-7207" title="Using MS Teams for Internal Communication: 5 Different Options 6"></figure>



<p>If anyone from the team records the call, the recording will be available for everyone to see in just a few minutes. So, even if you were on a plane, you can catch up with the entire call after you land. This includes all discussions and even the presentations itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting businesses of all sizes. With <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28 confirmed cases</a> in New Zealand as of 19 March, the government has stepped in to protect Kiwis both in the private and public sector. </p>



<p>Because of this, businesses are being forced to adopt flexible work arrangements to protect their staff, customers, and partners. That means implementing <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/remote-work/">remote work or working from home</a>. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, most Kiwi businesses aren&#8217;t prepared for this. That&#8217;s why we put together several free resources to help you cope in this situation. </p>



<h2>Free Microsoft Teams and Remote Work Training Webinars</h2>



<p>Communication and collaboration is key to situations like this. </p>



<p>One of the tools that can help with this is <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>. It&#8217;s a tool that we also use internally that allows everybody in the organisation to chat, call, and collaborate in one app. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about MS Teams, we&#8217;re conducting a series of free webinar training next week. Below is a list of the schedule:</p>



<ul><li>Monday, 23 March, 12:30 PM — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_WVWEyBc6Sbm27XGI9Oq8Yw" target="_blank">Reserve Your Spot</a></li><li>Wednesday, 25 March, 1:00 PM — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Reserve Your Spot (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_G2xkj4HYRqyptc8POBfYcA" target="_blank">Reserve Your Spot</a></li><li>Thursday, 26 March, 10:00 AM — <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Reserve Your Spot (opens in a new tab)" href="https://zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_uTp9dZHGSBOx3YRTcaAGXw" target="_blank">Reserve Your Spot</a></li><li>Monday, 30 March (Registration link to follow)</li><li>Wednesday, 1 April (Registration link to follow) </li></ul>



<h2>Curated Resources for Remote Work</h2>



<p>Implementing work from home setups can be challenging, especially if this is new for you. That&#8217;s why we put together a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/remote-work/">resource page for remote work</a> that you can use. We&#8217;ll be adding more in the future. </p>



<p>We looked at the situation from four different perspectives. </p>



<ol><li>CEO / Business Owner</li><li>CIO / IT Managers</li><li>Managers </li><li>Individual Contributors</li></ol>



<p>So, whether you are worried about your culture suffering, or the security of company data, or about your own productivity, we&#8217;ve got something for you. </p>



<h2>Remote Work Self Assessment Grader</h2>



<p>We also released a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/covid-19-remote-work-readiness-assessment/">grader/self-assessment tool</a> that gives you a score on whether you are ready to implement remote work or which areas you need to address first. </p>



<ul><li>Just answer 10 questions</li><li>It takes 2-3 minutes</li><li>Automatically emails you a report</li></ul>



<p>Do you think we missed any? Is there any topic you&#8217;d like to cover? <strong><em>Do let us know in the comments below</em></strong>.</p>

<p>There are various ways to use <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">MS Teams</a> in your organization. But, if you’re like most organizations, there is one area/section where you will spend the majority of your time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a reminder — this series isn’t meant to go through every feature of Microsoft Teams; rather, only highlight what we deem to be the most important ones that can help you be more productive and more effective.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Top 3 Highlights of Teams and Channels Tab</h2>



<h3>1. Teams vs Channels&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Let’s start with some basics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft Teams has two main areas. The left column which comprises of different tabs and sections, and the right column which contains the contents of each of those sections.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="616" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch6_teams_channels_section-1024x616.png" alt="Teams and Channels in MS Teams" class="wp-image-7202" title="Teams and Channels: How to Use Them in Microsoft Teams 7"></figure>



<p>Since MS Teams is the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-your-team-wants-teams/">hub for teamwork</a>, the area where you’ll spend your time the most is the Teams and Channels tab.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inside Microsoft Teams, Teams are groups of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="616" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch6_teams_channels-1024x616.png" alt="Difference Between Teams and Channels" class="wp-image-7205" title="Teams and Channels: How to Use Them in Microsoft Teams 8"></figure>



<p>Teams are made up of channels. Each channel is built around a topic like team events, a department name, or just for fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Channels are where you hold meetings, have conversations, or work on files together.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Show/Hide Non-Relevant Teams and Channels</h3>



<p>Depending on how big your organization is, or what teams you are a part of, this section will have a lot displayed, or little.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The good part is that you can customize what you want to appear in this section by hovering over the ellipses (…) and choose which channel you want to hide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, only the teams and channels that are important to you appear on the menu. This will help you focus on work, rather than reading through every single notification you see on your screen.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Customization Through Apps and Files</h3>



<p>One of the best features that makes MS Teams stand out from its competitors is the tabs section. These are located at the top of each channel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="337" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch6_teams_channels_tabs-1024x337.png" alt="Customise Different Tabs" class="wp-image-7204" title="Teams and Channels: How to Use Them in Microsoft Teams 9"></figure>



<p>Here, you can find “apps” and files that allow you to work directly INSIDE Teams with your colleagues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, your organization uses Asana to manage projects and keep track of tasks. You can add it by clicking on the plus (+) icon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you finish setting this up, everyone who has access to the channel can work on the file/app together.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="617" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ch6_teams_channels_tabs_asana-1024x617.png" alt="Asana Inside Tabs in Teams" class="wp-image-7203" title="Teams and Channels: How to Use Them in Microsoft Teams 10"></figure>



<p>Or, let’s say one of the things you regularly do is update an Excel or PowerPoint regularly. You also need to work with other people to get the data for different sections of the file.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Normally, you do this by finishing your work, saving the file, then emailing it to your colleague. They will, in turn, add their part, save it, email it to the next person. You all do this until you get the final version ready.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can easily do this inside Team without the need for moving or opening another app. If several people are working together on a report, they won’t have to send multiple versions to one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everything just becomes so much simple.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>The Teams and Channels tab/area/section is where you and your team will spend your time in the most. Spend a couple of minutes thinking about how you’re going to set this up to make it easy for everyone to work together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next chapter, I’ll share more about the different ways you can communicate / collaborate inside MS Teams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Quick question — do you love email?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re like most people, you probably don’t. But, it’s a necessary evil. It’s still the most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/314359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preferred medium of communication in business</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But did you know that email was invented in the 1970s? It’s almost 50 years since then. The way we use it has remained relatively the same — send one message to another, wait for their reply, read that reply some time in the future, and back all over again.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, the work we do today has evolved a lot. It requires faster communication and frequent collaboration. That’s why relying on email isn’t enough.&nbsp;That&#8217;s why tools like <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a> are being used by thousands of businesses around the world to transform their business. </p>



<h2>4 Reasons Why Email Is Not Enough</h2>



<p>Adobe conducted a <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/adobe/2019-adobe-email-usage-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Email Study</a> last year. One of the biggest takeaways in that study is that we spend a lot of time sending emails and following up on the emails we just sent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phrases like…</p>



<ul><li>now sure if you saw my last email, or</li><li>per my last email, or&nbsp;</li><li>any updates on this, or&nbsp;</li><li>as discussed&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>…were at the top of the list of the most annoying phrases people use at work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you have most likely experienced, email is easy to ignore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plus, with multiple people and organizations constantly spamming our email accounts, it makes it difficult to focus on the important ones in our inbox.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you’re like most people, you probably have multiple email accounts and receive hundreds of emails a day. This adds another layer of complexity and opens up a lot of other issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if you want to get ahead, there has got to be a better way, right?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. Today’s Work Requires More Collaboration and Communication</h3>



<p>The first reason why email is not enough is today’s work requires more collaboration and frequent communication with other people. More often than not, your work, including the work your entire organization does, rely on other people’s input.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine two businesses with the exact same resources, selling the exact same products. The only difference is the brand/company name. They are both in the same starting position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Company A decided to adapt a modern approach to work — i.e. to use technology to communicate with each other faster and collaborate easier; while Company B remains status quo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Who do you think will get ahead in 3-, 6-, 12- months’ time? Who do you think can launch faster and better products? Which one will be able to resolve new issues that come up during the course of business?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Short One-Off Questions in Emails Are Prevalent</h3>



<p>According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, the average employee&nbsp;<a href="https://fsd.servicemax.com/2018/01/09/8-reasons-email-is-ineffective-in-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spends 13 hours a week</a>&nbsp;checking, reading, and responding to email. That’s over 30% of the entire work week.&nbsp;In the Adobe study, this number was 17 hours per week — or roughly 42% of the work week. </p>



<p>Email isn’t meant for real-time communication and collaboration. If you emailed your boss asking a clarifying question and she doesn’t get back to until after 2 days, you’ve already lost those 2 days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this can extend to your colleagues and teammates, suppliers and vendors, and even customers. Imagine how much time you will lose if that person doesn’t reply to your email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, think about the effect to these delays to your organisation? Product launches? Extended R&amp;Ds? Growing number of irritated customers?&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Email Makes Remote Work Difficult </h3>



<p>Third, with the advent of technology, specifically the internet, it allowed for people to be <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/modern-workforce/">more mobile</a>. The internet gave people and companies the ability to work from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a team member might be working at a nearby cafe and get a lot more work done than being in the office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike before the rise of the internet and technology, most work were tangible. You literally see, feel, count, and assess them. For example, a shoemaker produces shoes. A car manufacturer produces cars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But today, a programmer can write code for months or years before the something tangible comes out of it (e.g. the new iOS 13 of Apple, or a new game).&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why frequent communication is essential in today’s competitive environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. You Limit Yourself With Local Talent </h3>



<p>One of the trends in the workplace right now is companies can take advantage of globalization. Organisations are no longer limited by the talent they find locally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With technology, you can tap the best talent you can find and work with them even if they are halfway across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re only using email, this will make it difficult for you to take advantage of their skills and talent. As mentioned earlier, frequent communication and constant collaboration is the hallmark of the today’s work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the team member who is halfway around the world doesn’t get the chance to mingle and develop a good working relationship with the others, that remote member will most likely leave in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>Microsoft dominates 72% of all desktop and laptop computers in the world with their operating system — Windows. And if you’re using Windows, you are most likely be using <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/empower-your-business-with-office-365/">Microsoft Office</a> suites — like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That means you are most likely paying (or paid) for MS Teams already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you’re paying for it already, and you know that it will make your communications better, why not make use of it? And if not, MS Teams has a free version that you can take advantage of in your organisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world is constantly evolving. That means if you want to thrive, you also have to adapt to these changes. And that means providing your organisation with tools to make them more productive. It means enabling them so they can spend less time worrying about internal issues, and instead focus on what really matters — your customers.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One of the signs your organisation has kept up with the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">digital age</a>&nbsp;is the use of a&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/top-collaboration-software-for-new-zealand-businesses/">collaboration tool or software</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Have you ever experienced any of these scenarios?&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Sent numerous emails but don’t get replies</li><li>Can’t seem to find the conversation you had with a customer or colleague</li><li>Misunderstood each other from an email (or SMS) because of the lack of context&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Now, think about the repercussions of these things in your business. If you can’t get a&nbsp;<em>timely</em>&nbsp;reply from your boss, colleague, or supplier, it would cause delays in any projects you are working on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that’s related to a product launch, that would mean you’d be incurring additional expenses&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;losing potential revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if you could avoid all these issues/scenarios and instead focus on working collaboratively with your team?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, you will learn how you can use&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>&nbsp;to overcome these kinds of issue, and take advantage of it so you can adapt to changes in the market faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft Teams is an app that allows you to communicate with your teammates anytime and anywhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, it allows your organization to chat or message one another. But it goes beyond that. It also features calls, video conferencing, and screen sharing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4 Reasons to Implement MS Teams&nbsp;</h2>



<p>MS Teams meets all the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-microsoft-teams/">criteria you need for choosing a collaboration software</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, it’s a&nbsp;<strong>multi-platform app</strong>. Whether you’re using a Mac or Windows, on-the-go on your mobile phone, or in the office, you can take MS Teams along with you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, it’s&nbsp;<strong>built with privacy and security</strong>&nbsp;in mind. Everything is encrypted automatically, so you don’t have to worry about privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For business owners and IT administrators,&nbsp;<strong>user level access</strong>&nbsp;is simple and easy to do. You can easily create accounts for each member of the team, and even add guests or outsiders like your customers, partners, or other contractors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, if you’re already using Microsoft products, then you’re most likely paying for MS Teams already. That means you&nbsp;<strong>don’t have to pay</strong>for anything additional to increase your organization’s productivity.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How to Use Microsoft Teams: 3 Key Capabilities You Need to Know</h2>



<p>In the previous article, we mentioned that the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/build-strong-foundation/">success of any change initiative</a>&nbsp;lies in the commitment of leadership, gaining inputs from key stakeholders, and focusing on the future instead of the now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We won’t go into the technical details of how to implement MS Teams, rather, below are 3 key capabilities you need to know.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. The Right Message for the Right Time (Context) </h3>



<p>In MS Teams, you can chat/message an individual or a group of people. You can also call, leave a voice message, or have a video meeting with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just think of the last time you read an email and thought your colleague was being rude to you only to find out later that he was just making a joke.&nbsp;<strong>Context is often lost</strong>&nbsp;in written communication, like email.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or just think of the last time you were emailing back-and-forth with a colleague only to find out later that you were talking about two different projects?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the best form of communication is still face-to-face, sometimes, that is impossible because of the nature of our work. Sometimes, our work requires us to travel or work with remote teammates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, if you were to hop on a call together, that misunderstanding could have been avoided. In just a few clicks, you can do all of them inside MS Teams.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Recordings and Screen Sharing</h3>



<p>Meetings are a fact of organizational life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a professional, you meet with your boss, your peers, your subordinates (or staff). Outside the organisation, you meet with customers, partners and vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we rely on more people to get our own work done, it’s imperative that we work smarter and avoid/reduce misunderstandings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MS Teams allows you to use a different medium to communicate more effectively. You can use chat/messaging, calls, or leave voice notes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See related:&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-teams-vs-skype-for-business/">Microsoft Teams vs Skype for Business</a></p>



<p>But one of the most-used feature of Teams is the ability to do video calls. It’s the&nbsp;<em>modern&nbsp;</em>way of meeting where it looks and feels like you are meeting face-to-face. During the call, you can also share your screen as if you were presenting in front of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also record the call so that you can later go back to it, or if someone was late or couldn’t make it, they can review and watch the meeting itself. There’s no more need to spend time catching up your colleague.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>3. Integrations</h3>



<p>MS Teams also allow you to work together with your team more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams allow you to add integrations like embedding an Excel spreadsheet directly so you or anyone else who needs to update or view it can do so without opening Excel or leaving the Teams app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For channels dedicated to certain projects, you can add all the notes in one place (wiki). This can include a brief background on the project plus decisions made over time. This benefits everyone because the notes only exist in one place, guaranteeing that it’s the most up-to-date version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have a project management software that you’re using, like Asana, you can also add your projects directly. This way, everyone can stay on the same page and can add/update/modify/know the status in real time.&nbsp;</p>
