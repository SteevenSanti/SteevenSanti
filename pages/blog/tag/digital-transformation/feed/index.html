<p>After <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/build-strong-foundation/">building a strong foundation</a> and addressing your business’ vision, culture, and leadership, it’s time to move the different aspects of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">digital transformation</a>. </p>



<p><em>Remember that the road to digital transformation is different for everybody. </em></p>



<ul><li>Does your company limit the amount of email storage you can have at any time? </li><li>Do you have to keep deleting your messages because your inbox is full and can’t receive new messages? </li><li>Or have you experienced not being able to access your email for a couple of days because your IT department is doing some server maintenance? </li></ul>



<p>What if you didn’t have to deal with this problem anymore? What if you have virtually unlimited storage? What if you can access your emails 24/7, anywhere you are in the world? </p>


<div id="rank-math-faq" class="rank-math-block">

<h3 class="rank-math-question ">Why should you use cloud-based email?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Using cloud-based email allows you more flexibility in storage, less maintenance, scalability, and many more. Find out the 7 reasons why you should migrate your email to the cloud. </p>
</div>
</div>

</div>


<h2>7 Reasons to Migrate Your Email to the Cloud</h2>



<p>Migrating email from a self-hosted to cloud-hosted might seem like a very simple task. But if you look at it more closely, there are a few variables you need to consider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to create a seamless migration from your local mail server to the cloud (like Microsoft or Google), all user accounts and data must remain in-tact. This includes every single mail folder and every message. Users should not be able to detect that anything has changed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. More storage</h3>



<p>Migrating to a cloud-based email allows you to virtually have unlimited storage. On-premise email servers are often limited by their storage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, your IT administrator might only allow you to keep 512 MB worth of email at any point in time. When your usage exceeds that, you won’t be able to receive new messages. You will then have to delete some (or all) your email before you receive new messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine the consequences of this to your business if you forget to manage your email storage. What do you think would happen if you miss emails like these:</p>



<ul><li>email from a dissatisfied customer who happens to also be one of your key accounts</li><li>email from a supplier/vendor saying that they won’t be able to deliver your order on time — which would cause you to miss your own targets</li><li>email from your boss or colleague about a critical status update on a project you are working on</li></ul>



<p>When you migrate your email to the cloud, you won’t have to deal with these issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because all cloud email providers start you off with a huge amount of storage. For example, a personal Gmail account will give you 15 Gb of storage, while a business account starts with 30Gb. A Microsoft subscription will start you off with 1 Gb per user.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Faster disaster recovery</h3>



<p>Most businesses don’t often think of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protecting-critical-data-in-your-business/">disaster recovery</a> until it happens to them. By then, it would be too late. </p>



<p>Let’s say a fire started in your office caused by one of the other tenants in the building. What if this happened during the weekend?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have a disaster recovery program in place and your office got caught in the fire (or flood, or earthquake, or some other disaster), how long do you think you can resume business?&nbsp;</p>



<p>With cloud-based email, you won’t have to worry about this yourself. Your provider will take care of this for you. And more likely, they will already have a disaster recovery program in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, Microsoft and Google (two big names in cloud-hosted email) have millions of servers (housed inside data centres) across the world. So, if something happened to the data centre in North America or Asia, you would still be able to access your emails because they are backed up in another data centre in another continent. </p>



<h3>3. Less server maintenance&nbsp;</h3>



<p>One of the best practices of on-site servers is to conduct frequent preventive maintenance. This ensures that both the hardware and software running is at optimal conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/backups/">Backups</a> and other stuff are performed during this time as well. </p>



<p>While this practice is true for all servers, if you’re using a cloud-based email that means you don’t have to do this yourself. </p>



<p>You don’t have to allot resources — time and money — to do the maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oftentimes, when your IT administrator performs server maintenance, work stops for the entire business. That’s why maintenance work is done during weekends and/or nighttime or early morning. </p>



<p>But in today’s world where our customers expect us to be there for them 24/7, we can’t afford to be “offline” for a couple of days.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. Enable remote work</h3>



<p>As you may have already noticed, the work you do today can be done outside the office. As technology improves, you can pretty much do a lot of things with a laptop or your phone and an internet connection. That means you don’t need to be in the office in order to work.</p>



<p>This is the trend globally — <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/inside-the-modern-workplace-is-your-organisation-ready/">remote work or telecommuting</a>. That’s why you see people working in cafes, at home, or even in transit. </p>



<p>With an on-premise email server, you won’t have this luxury. Sometimes, you can only access your email if you’re connected to the company network. That means you have to be in your office premises. </p>



<p>Or in other cases, you will be limited by your access. </p>



<p>Oftentimes, you can only access your email accounts from a work-issued device. So, if you happen to forget that at home or left it at the office, you can’t check your email using your phone or personal laptop. </p>



<h3>5. Cost savings</h3>



<p>The pricing of cloud-based email is often on a per-user basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means is you don’t have to pay upfront a huge amount as compared to when you use an on-premise server. Depending on the one you buy, this could easily be a few thousand dollars. This will probably last you for 2-3 years before it starts showing signs of aging. By then, you will have to decide whether to upgrade or buy a new one (which would then cost you another thousand dollars). Of course, you’d also have to do regular maintenance on it to make it last longer which also costs money. </p>



<p class="toc"><strong>Related</strong>: <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud/">Good Seed Trust Migrates 100% to the Cloud After Experiencing Server Issues</a></p>



<p>For cloud-based email, you will only be paying ~$5 per person. Plus, most of these provides offer a lot more than just email. For example, a Microsoft Office 365 account will also give you access to the office suites (Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and 1 Tb of storage. Now that’s value for money.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>6. Flexible Scalability</h3>



<p>A cloud-based email also gives you flexibility, not just in terms of costs, but also your options as a business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you hire additional people during the holidays and cut back after it. This can easily be done with cloud-based email as you can add accounts easily, then once they leave, you can assign and transfer all their emails and files to another person.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>7. Improved Security</h3>



<p>You might think of having on-premise servers as being more secured than being hosted on the cloud. Unless you can invest in your own 24/7 security and backup recovery system (as discussed earlier), you won’t be able to match the level of security of the big cloud providers like Google and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>Migrating your emails to the cloud gives you a lot of flexibility in your business. It allows you to focus on the more important things, rather than spending it on administrative tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some believe that by 2028,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/73-of-all-teams-will-have-remote-workers-in-the-next-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">73% of all teams will have remote workers</a>. If you aren’t ready or not preparing for it, it will be harder for you to attract and retain talent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Migrating to the cloud isn’t only for big companies. It’s not only for those in the tech industry, too. The cloud is <strong>for everyone</strong> who wants to stay relevant amidst the changing market conditions today and tomorrow. </p>



<p>Are you ready to take advantage of cloud-based email?</p>

<p>If you want your business to undergo a successful <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">digital transformation</a>, the first step you have to do is build a strong foundation. You’ll also learn why it’s critical to get this step right before anything else. </p>



<p>Have you ever implemented a change initiative only to fail later on? No matter how big or small that change is, more often than not, you’ve experienced failure just like me and everyone else. </p>



<p>Oftentimes, the reason for failure is <strong>not </strong>because the idea itself is bad. In fact, the reason you tried implementing it must mean it’s a great idea and has tons of benefits. Yet it still failed. </p>



<p>Think back about the last change initiative you implemented that failed. Now think about
the one that succeeded.
</p>



<p>What if you could implement any change initiative, especially a big one such as digital
transformation, and make sure that your entire organisation accepts it?
</p>



<p>Some examples of these changes initiatives might be one of the following:
</p>



<ol><li> New/additional reporting or meeting </li><li> New tech/tool like <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">MS Teams</a> or Asana </li><li> New HR Policy</li></ol>



<p>Here are three things you need to do to increase the chances of success of any change initiative&#8230; </p>



<h2>3 Things You Need to Do to Make
Your Change Initiative Successful
</h2>



<h3>1. Get real commitment from the top
</h3>



<p>Without a concrete commitment from the top — this includes the board, c-suite, and top management — your change initiative will most likely fail. </p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because of accountability, or the lack of it. </p>



<p>For example, in our own projects, oftentimes, the business owner is the one leading the
project. He stays on top of it, attends meetings, resolves issues, etc.
</p>



<p>If you recently tried to implement a change initiative (or a couple of them), your staff would
most likely be thinking the same thing — that this is just a fad and that no one will follow
through. So, they’ll just do as little work as possible.
</p>



<p>Then that new initiative will fail.
</p>



<p>So, before implementing any change, <strong>get real commitment from the top</strong>. Find a sponsor who will take responsibility and accountability to the entire initiative. This person will <strong>oversee </strong>the entire implementation, even if he/she will not be the one doing the implementation. This way, everyone knows that this change initiative is serious because someone from top management is overseeing it. </p>



<h3>2. Ask input from all levels of the organisation
</h3>



<p>Organizational inertia is one of the things every business leader needs to overcome. What that means is your staff will <em>reject </em>anything that threatens the way they do things. Change does that, even if it’s beneficial for everyone.<br> The only way to combat this fear is to <strong>engage in a <a href="https://www.blueoceanstrategy.com/tools/fair-process/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fair process</a></strong>. </p>



<p>The key is to have an open discussion about why the adoption of the new idea is necessary. People want to know that their voices have been heard and that there are no surprises. </p>



<p>The important part is to do this <em>before </em>you do anything.</p>



<p>Avoiding this step might be easy for business owners and top management. But if you don’t do it, the chances for failure are higher. </p>



<p>Your staff don’t want to get blindsided. Talk to them about the changes and why it’s important. Tell them what will happen if you and the entire organisation don’t succeed in this change. Discuss whether this change will affect how their jobs will change and whether this will be part of their evaluation. </p>



<p>Resolving these questions before, during, and after the change initiative ensures that your
entire organisation will see the real benefits of it, rather than fear the change initiative.
</p>



<h3>3. Shift your conversations to talk about the future
</h3>



<p>Out of sight, out of mind.
</p>



<p>That’s a phrase you’ve heard dozens of times, but might never think about it in the business context. </p>



<p>The problem with focusing on the now is it doesn’t help you with the future. Oftentimes, the
<em>now </em>is focused on <em>fire-fighting</em>.
</p>



<p>If you don’t talk and plan for the future, it means you are not prepared for when it arrives.
Remember, what got you here won’t get you there.
</p>



<p>If you keep talking about the same things, doing the same things over and over, one day you will find yourself left behind by your competitors. </p>



<h2>Over to You
</h2>



<p>Building a strong foundation is all about addressing the hidden/soft issues in your organisation. </p>



<p>If you don’t know where you’re going, or if people aren’t clear on where to go, implementing
any change will only add to that confusion.
</p>



<p>That’s why it’s important to get commitment from the leadership team from the start before
embarking on any change initiative.
</p>



<p>Asking for inputs from key stakeholders, even if they are ridiculous, even if the suggestions
don’t get implemented, that’s ok. Engaging in a discussion ensures that they get heard.
This is the most important part of any change initiative.
</p>



<p>This reduces the risk of them “sabotaging” the initiative later on.
</p>



<p>Lastly, shifting your conversations to the future will get everyone thinking about it. If the
market is changing or heading in a certain direction, and you do nothing or continue doing
what you have been doing 5 years ago, you will definitely get left behind.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Does your business have an unfair advantage in today’s competitive environment? Or are you simply “getting by” or “barely surviving”? </p>



<p>Is your business thriving in today’s digital age? Or are you still relying on outdated technology while your competitors are investing in new, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">emerging technologies</a>? </p>



<p>We all know that the market is constantly changing. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/3-undeniable-challenges-facing-new-zealand-businesses-today/">Customers are always expecting more</a> from you — more value for less money. </p>



<p>The only way to remain relevant is to adapt to these changes. </p>



<p>And that means your business has to go through a digital transformation. </p>



<h2>What Is Digital Transformation</h2>



<p>Now, what exactly is digital transformation? </p>



<p>For most people, it’s about going paperless. And while going paperless is definitely a part of it, digital transformation goes beyond that, especially if you look at it from an organizational perspective. </p>



<p>Digital transformation is the use of new, fast, and frequently changing digital technologies to create — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. </p>



<h2>Digital Transformation Examples</h2>



<p>An easy way to understand digital transformation is to look at our personal lives. Below are three examples of how digital transformation has completely permeated our lives. </p>



<h3>Example 1: File Storage</h3>



<p>Before, if you want to save the photos and files in your computers and phones, you would have to buy an external hard drive. But now, because of the availability of online storage providers services, you don’t need to buy that hard drive anymore. Some popular brands out there are Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud. </p>



<h3>Example 2: Movies and Entertainment</h3>



<p>Or let’s say you wanted to watch a movie that isn’t on the big screen right now. </p>



<p>Today, you would just open up your Netflix or Hulu or Amazon account, and you can stream any movie or TV series available. </p>



<p>For those who aren’t familiar, there was a time where you would have to go to a video store, buy or rent a DVD or VHS, go back to your house, and plug it into a specific player before you can watch that movie. </p>



<p>After which you’ll have to return it (if you only rented it), or find a place at home to store all those CDs. </p>



<h3>Example 3: Music</h3>



<p>This goes the same for music. </p>



<p>Before Spotify and (insert name here), the only way for you go get your music is to buy them from record stores. The latest medium for music before it went <em>digital</em> is in the form of CDs as well. Before that, they were in cassettes. </p>



<p>And just like playing movies, you’d have bought a specific player for you to play your music. Heard of the Sony Walkman? </p>



<p>Now, we can do all the things we listed above (and more) with just our phones. That’s how much digital transformation has influenced our lives. </p>



<p>But this doesn’t seem to be the case for businesses. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Digital transformation is the use of new, fast, and frequently changing digital technologies to create — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. </p></blockquote>



<h2>Digital Transformation for Businesses</h2>



<p>Another way to look at digital transformation is by using cloud computing while reducing reliance on user-owned hardware. This is what we’ll be focusing on— <strong>The ROI to businesses when they invest in digital transformation</strong>. </p>



<p>One of the reasons why most New Zealand businesses haven’t invested in digital transformation goes back to IT service providers like us. Oftentimes, we make such a big deal out of it that it makes things complicated for people like you. </p>



<p>That’s why most business leaders stay away from it. Instead, they rely on what is familiar to them. </p>



<p>Technology has permeated every aspect of our personal lives. We have powerful computers in our pockets, smart devices, and home automation systems. </p>



<p>But in the workplace, a lot of businesses are still using technology like it was in the 90s or early 2000s. </p>



<p>In today’s fast-changing world, it becomes critical to adapt to these changes. Otherwise, you’d get left behind. </p>



<p>No doubt you have heard of stories of big brands becoming irrelevant simply because they failed to adapt to these changes. They conducted business as if it was status quo while the rest of the market changed. </p>



<p>They <strong>chose to ignore</strong> that the times are changing and that’s the reason why they failed. </p>



<p><a href="http://content.quanton.co.nz/blog/the-digital-revolution-its-not-about-technology?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=79515284&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--21Hs00AsJTXl1K-qYqu81e71nzFWiaOj-dZ080Kcbyun9Ih12Zgdiuu20qYq92eP6jDKtIsub_OSkgHO5jkrnnVBs2g&amp;_hsmi=79515284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology is not the solution by itself</a>. Rather, it’s a tool that will allow you to overcome the challenges you’re facing in your business right now. </p>



<p>Digital transformation is a complex topic, but it doesn’t have to be. We broke down digital transformation into four separate categories. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick overview&#8230;<br></p>



<h2>Overview of Digital Transformation</h2>



<h3>No. 1: Build a Strong Foundation</h3>



<p>First, you’ll need to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/build-strong-foundation/">build a strong foundation</a>. </p>



<p>As you already know, <strong>implementing change in your business is difficult</strong>. Without the commitment from top management, people don’t put in enough effort to make the change succeed. Without input from the end-users, new technology is often seen as a fad, pushed down their throats — making it difficult to accept the change initiative, and at times, actively sabotage the initiative. </p>



<p>And just like when building a house, if you don’t start with a strong foundation, everything you put on top crumbles easily. </p>



<h3>No. 2: Cloud-Based Email: Higher Productivity at Lower Costs</h3>



<p>After setting up a strong foundation, the next step is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cloud-based-email/">migrate your email to the cloud</a>. If you’re new to using cloud technology, this is the easiest transition you can make. </p>



<p>The main goal here is a <strong>seamless transition</strong> from your email server to a cloud-based one. Your staff leaves the office on Friday afternoon. They come back on Monday morning as if nothing happened. </p>



<p>Using a cloud-based email will help your organisation be more productive while lowering your costs. Now, that’s a good investment. </p>



<h3>No. 3: Work Better: Implementing a Hub for Teamwork</h3>



<p>It’s no secret that the faster you adapt to the changing customer demands, the better your business will be in the long-run. </p>



<p>The simplest way for your entire organisation to adapt faster is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/work-better-implementing-hub-for-teamwork/">communicate faster and work more efficiently</a>. And the tool that will help you achieve that is a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">collaboration and communication software</a>. </p>



<h3>No. 4: Shared Storage for Everyone: Never Deal with Duplicates Again</h3>



<p>Ever find yourself looking for a file — whether that’s a report or a spreadsheet — and you end up searching for 15 minutes and you still couldn’t find the one you’re looking for? </p>



<p>Or what about that time where you couldn’t figure out which version is the real “final” version because there are dozens of files with the word “final” in the filename. </p>



<p>These frustrations are common in every organisation. And the easiest way to make sure you find what you’re looking for and not waste your time searching over and over is to use a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">shared cloud storage</a> for all your files and documents. </p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>If you want to remain competitive and relevant in your industry, you have to accept the reality that status quo isn’t acceptable. </p>



<p>The market is always changing. That’s why you should also be changing. </p>



<p>If you don’t do something, you will get left behind.</p>
