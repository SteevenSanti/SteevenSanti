<p>Chances are you have already used Wi‐Fi today. It’s become a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">fundamental part of being connected</a>, both literally and figuratively. It’s essential for the family around home, getting work done at the office, and deciding where to have your coffee break.</p>



<p>If you want to get work done away from the office, public Wi‐Fi networks have become essential and many will choose a café with Wi‐Fi over one that doesn’t.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many people don’t fully understand the risks of using wireless technology in business.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Related post</strong>: <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">15 Myths You Should Stop Believing in 2019</a></p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">Don&#8217;t want to get hacked, follow these 21 cyber security tips</a>. Here are two main threats to watch out for.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Top 2 Threats to Using Wi-Fi</h3>



<h3>1. The Evil Twin</h3>



<p>Simply, it’s a network that looks just like the regular Wi‐Fi network at your favourite café. Only once you’re connected, the hacker who created the network is able to monitor every move you make. </p>



<p>They’ll be looking out for sensitive information like login details, bank accounts, and credit card information.</p>

<h3>2. The ‘War Driver’</h3>



<p>The issue with common WiFi networks is that anyone can log on. You dont know who you’re sharing a connection with. A hacker can search for devices connected to the same network and intercept data being exchanged across it.</p>



<p>If your business has an open Wi‐Fi network, it’s possible for someone to get within range and intercept company emails. They might also be able to connect to your local network and search through your computers for business documents.</p>



<p>These aren’t theoretical issues. While sitting in a coffee shop in 2014, a couple logged onto the public network and transferred a six‐figure sum into a term deposit account. A ‘war driver’ found their account details, and an email with a signed employment contract attached. Using both, the hacker impersonated them and cleaned out the account.</p>



<p>In this case, the Banking Ombudsman found the bank’s online security was also lacking, and ordered them to repay the couple, but you may not be so lucky.</p>



<p>You don’t have to give up on public Wi‐Fi altogether. There are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">measures you can take to protect yourself and your company data</a>. </p>



<h2>Two Tips to Use Wireless Technology Safely</h2>



<h3>Tip #1: Use a VPN</h3>



<p>The easiest solution is a VPN or virtual private network. A VPN can be used on any device to form a secure connection between it and the internet, encrypting all transferred information. If you accidentally connect to an ‘Evil Twin,’ the encryption prevents the hacker from accessing your data.</p>



<p>It’s important to research VPN providers before signing up. All your data is being transferred through them, so they could steal all your information as easily as any hacker. Trust and reputation is important.</p>



<h3>Tip #2: Use a Wi-Fi Password and Change It Regularly</h3>



<p>Put a password on your office Wi‐Fi network and change it regularly. It might be annoying for you and your team, but it’s far less annoying than all of your sensitive files ending up in public. </p>



<p>It’s also worth looking at a firewall to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic through your network. A firewall will let you know if someone is trying to force their way in, and if you need to boost security even further.</p>



<p>There are risks with any online activity, but a VPN and firewall can help protect you and your business while browsing in public.</p>

<p>Think you’re protected from <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> threats because you’ve got firewalls and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-signs-you-probably-need-new-antivirus-software-security/">antivirus software</a>? Think again. </p>



<p>You must secure your wireless network, too. <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">Staying safe in the digital age</a>&nbsp;is extremely challenging because there are so many ‘gaps’ or ‘windows’ that hackers can jump through. How to secure your wireless network &#8211; and&nbsp;protect yourself and your business – simply comes down to finding ways to seal all of these gaps  as efficiently as possible. </p>



<h2>Keeping hackers out is a like trying to keep a New Zealand home warm in winter</h2>



<p>Kiwi houses are notoriously difficult to heat due to a lack of  insulation, double-glazed windows, or adequate ventilation systems. If you live in a cold, damp house, the challenge is to identify all the  areas where heat is escaping and fix them accordingly. For example, you might need to take the following actions: </p>



<ul><li>install insulation in the ceiling, walls and beneath the floorboards;</li><li>seal any gaps in the framework, including around windows and under doors;</li><li>invest in a heating or ventilation system, such as HRV or a heat pump;</li><li>put up thermal-lined curtains to keep the warmth in at night; or</li><li>retrofit your home with double-glazed windows.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, doing one of these things isn’t enough in isolation. If you buy a heat pump but fail to seal your windows or install insulation without curtains, then the heat will simply escape through other gaps.  </p>



<p>While you may not be able to afford to do everything on the list, you should <strong>combine as many actions as you can</strong> for maximum energy efficiency. The same mentality can be applied to&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;(although it’s important to keep in mind that the consequences of a hacked network tend to be more problematic than those of a cold house).  </p>



<p>Consequences aside, the point is – you need to take a collaborative approach to cyber security. <strong>There’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution</strong>. Seal as many gaps as you can. </p>



<h2><strong>One gap that many businesses overlook is their wireless network</strong></h2>



<p>An unsecured wireless network is vulnerable to hackers, malware, and  other suspicious activity. </p>



<p>To quote&nbsp;WatchGuard,&nbsp;“Today’s network threats aren’t tethered to the desktop. Your security can’t be, either.” </p>



<p>According to WatchGuard’s director of product management, Ryan Orsi, wireless threats are becoming more frequent and problematic due to the availability of public wifi networks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Organisations across all industries are facing increased 
pressure from customers, vendors, and employees to offer wireless 
access. Unfortunately, hackers are also constantly trying to gain a 
foothold into the network,”</p></blockquote>



<p>Ryan Orsi goes on to&nbsp;recommend that all organisations implement improved security, in particular on wifi networks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Businesses that fail to properly secure their wifi 
networks, including guest hotspots, may expose customers, partners, and 
internal users to a variety of risks.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Exposing such threats could be extremely damaging to your reputation as a  business and cause your customers to look elsewhere. When viewed in this light, wireless security is as much about protecting your reputation – and giving your customers peace of mind – as it is about protecting your security.</p>



<p>WatchGuard offers a number of products and features to secure <strong>your wifi networks, such as the WatchGuard Firebox T30 and T50, the WatchGuard Firebox T10, and WatchGuard Access Points.
