<p>We’ve talked a lot about&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;here on our blog and our social media accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why? Because it’s really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet most business leaders still don’t put too much thought into how they can protect their business. Most of them still believe in&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">cyber security myths</a>&nbsp;like “we’re just a small business, we won’t be targeted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you didn’t already know, the vast majority of cyber attacks aren’t targeted. Meaning, whether you’re a large corporation with thousands of employees or a small business with just one staff, you can still fall victim to a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cyber criminals don’t discriminate</strong>!&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
</div>



<p>Another excuse we often hear is “we don’t need it” or “we’ll deal with it when we get there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you already know, this isn’t a very sound plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most common cyber attacks is in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">malware</a>&nbsp;. All it takes is one person to open a link or download a file —whether intentional or accidental— for a cyber criminal to gain access to your network and devices. When that happens, all your files will be inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you think you can do business if you lose access to all your data?</p>



<p>Interested now? Below are 10 tips you can follow to protect your your business.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>10 Simple Ways to Protect Your Business Online</h2>



<h3 id="mfa">1. Enable multi-factor authentication</h3>



<p>Usernames and passwords are a key target for hackers, and with good reason — your identity and data are your most valuable asset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last January 2019, the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">biggest data breach</a>&nbsp;(yet) exposed over 1.2 billion email addresses. A few months after, one of the most well-known&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">online graphics software</a>&nbsp;also had a breach that impacted 137 million subscribers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">Strong and secure passwords</a>&nbsp;go a long way, but passwords alone are not the most secure authentication mechanism. Watch this video of a&nbsp;<strong>lesser-known</strong>hacking that could wind up getting unnoticed by you or anyone in your organization.&nbsp;</p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kxlgfmbu2t.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_kxlgfmbu2t popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true videoFoam=true" style="display:inline-block;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">&nbsp;</span></div></div>



<p>Here are some quick facts:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>90% of data stolen by phishing are user credentials.&nbsp;</li><li>80-90% of passwords can be hacked in under 24 hours.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) gives you an additional layer of security. If you have MFA enabled in your accounts, you will be required to use two or more independent credentials to prove your identity. Once you finish those&nbsp;<em>extra&nbsp;</em>steps, only then will you be able to access your account.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="password">2. Strengthen your passwords</h3>



<p>Passwords are ubiquitous in our daily lives. From email to social media to bank accounts — we all have passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are the first line of defense in protecting your identity and data. Sadly, far too often, they are also the only line of defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at these statistics:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>59% know a secure password is important, yet only 41% choose a password that is easy to remember.&nbsp;</li><li>91% understand the risk of reusing passwords, but 55% do it anyway.</li></ul>



<p>If your device or service doesn’t support MFA, the next best option is making your password harder to crack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/hp_cyber-security-field-manual_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">cyber security manual</a>&nbsp;provides more information like using a mnemonic over numeric ones. To learn more, you can download the PDF by clicking on the link above.</p>



<p>One other way you can create a strong password that is virtually impossible for hackers to crack is to use a password manager.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, it’s another service that forces you to create another account and remember another password. But, what if that’s the only password you need to remember for the rest of your life? Head on over here to&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">watch this step-by-step tutorial</a>&nbsp;of how to use one of the most popular password managers out there.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="antimalware">3. Use anti malware software</h3>



<p>Without an anti-malware or antivirus software, your PC could be infected by malware within minutes of connecting to the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have one, get one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a lot of anti malware software out there to choose from. There are free and paid ones. Of course, the free ones will have limited capabilities, but it’s still better than having zero protection for your devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re running Windows 10, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/hp_cyber-security-field-manual_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">download this manual</a>&nbsp;for instructions on how to make sure it is running and how to keep it running — as it is common for malware to first target security programs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="update">4. Keep your software up to date</h3>



<p>More and more malware is created every day. They are getting more sophisticated and intelligent that they can bypass anti-malware software from time to time.</p>



<p>But the fact remains that&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-2008-end-of-support/">the older your software, the less secure it is</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why the most common ways for manufacturers and brands to combat vulnerabilities is by releasing updates or patches. This applies to both operating systems (OS) like Windows or Mac, and all the applications running on your computer like internet browsers, office applications, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important group of devices to highlight are the Internet of Things (IoT) devices you have at home. These are your routers, smart speakers, CCTV cameras, light bulbs, and media centers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="browser">5. Secure your browser</h3>



<p>The #1 way we connect to the internet is through an internet browser. We use it for checking email, browsing social media, and searching the web for answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why it’s also the #1 target for hackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attacks via browsers typically come by way of an accidental or intentional click on a link that launches malware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are four quick tips to ensure you reduce your chances of a malware attack:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><strong>Use a secure browser</strong> — A quick Google search of the topic reveals big names such as Firefox and Chrome as the most secured browser. </li><li><strong>Heed warnings</strong> — If the browser detects you are visiting a (potentially) malicious site, it often shows you a warning page first. </li><li><strong>Keep it current</strong> — As previously mentioned, updates provide fixes to bugs and vulnerabilities. Enable automatic browser updates so you don’t have to worry about this again. </li><li><strong>Restrict content and plugins</strong> — Many browsers allow for plugins or extensions. Consider reviewing them and limiting your usage to the ones that you trust. </li></ol>

<h3 id="router">6. Router security and private network</h3>



<p>Anyone who connects to the interned does so through a router. This hardware device, either wired or wireless, allows communication between the internet and your local network (i.e. your computer and possibly other connected devices).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a 2018 report, routers were cited as the most frequently exploited type of device in IoT attacks. Hackers can use malware in design flaws to hide their identity, steal bandwidth, turn your devices into botnet zombies —or worse. They can also take advantage of any unsecured devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like with your browsers, here are 4 tips you can do to secure your network at home or work:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Secure your network</strong>&nbsp;using a non-default administrator password. Note that this is different from your Wi-Fi password. This is the access to the administrator settings of your router.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Configure the highest encryption</strong>&nbsp;supported by your router. Going from the strongest to the weakest, these are as follows:&nbsp;<ol><li>WPA3</li><li>WPA2</li><li>WPA</li><li>WEP</li></ol></li><li><strong>Keep your firmware up to date</strong>. According to one study,&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">83% of routers have vulnerabilities</a>. A router with the latest updates is much less likely to be infected by malware.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong>&nbsp;to add another layer of protection to your identity and information.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3 id="wifi">7. Protect yourself on public Wi-Fi</h3>



<p>Public Wi-Fi is everywhere — cafes, airports, shopping malls, and outdoor parks. They’re incredibly convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the public nature of these connections, there’s a real chance someone could take advantage of unsecured traffic. Watch this video to understand one of the real threats from an unprotected Wi-Fi network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to reduce your risks on public Wi-Fi is to limit your activity. Don’t work on any “sensitive” documents and send them over the network. If you must, make sure you stick to encrypted sites and use a VPN.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="visual">8. Stop visual hackers</h3>



<p>As the modern workplace continues to move outside traditional offices to remote and public spaces, the possibility of being “visually hacked” is more real than ever. It’s simple, effective, and often gets unnoticed until it is too late.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to protect yourself is to be aware of your environment. Always assume that someone could look over your shoulder and see what’s on your screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also consider using privacy filters on your devices, but that would only work if they viewing at a certain angle. According to a research published by the Ponemon Institute:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>91% visual hacking attempts were successful</li><li>68% of visual hacking attempts went unnoticed by the victim</li><li>52% of sensitive information was captured directly from device screens</li></ul>



<h3 id="encrypt">9. Encrypt your data</h3>



<p>Do you know where your files and data are stored in your computer or laptop?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hard drive, or in more modern devices, the solid state drive (SSD).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But did you know that your computer’s hard drive is only held in place by a few screws? Once removed, your hard drive can be access on another device. And if you haven’t enabled encryption on your hard drive, anybody can easily access your data and other sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re using a Mac or Windows, make sure that it is encrypted. And take note,&nbsp;<strong>encryption of your hard drive is different from having a password on your device</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That password only opens your device by default. You still have to enable encryption yourself. For example, on a Mac, that would mean turning on the FileVault under the Security &amp; Privacy setting.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="436" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/filevault-mac-1024x436.png" alt="FileVault Encryption on Mac" class="wp-image-7856" title="10 Steps Every Business Should Take to Protect Against Cyber Attacks 3"></figure>



<p>For Windows 10, there is a feature called BitLocker that provides software encryption that can be unlocked with a hardware key.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="bios">10. Secure your PC below the OS</h3>



<p>The BIOS (basic input output software) is software that boots a computer and helps load the operating system. By infecting this core software, hackers can plant malware that remains live and undetected by antivirus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a hacker gains access to your BIOS, they essentially own every aspect of your PC. By keeping your software updated, any discovered vulnerability will have been fixed in the update. Another way to reduce your risk is to implement a BIOS password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also limit unused features such as booting from external devices. Keeping this setting on can allow for malware to be loaded from external sources. If you really need to, that’s the only time you turn it on.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>Cyber security is a very important topic that business leaders like you should take seriously. The risks to your organisation is very real and very huge. More than 60% of businesses have shut down within 6 months after a successful cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier last year, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> implemented a new network solution to improve their security architecture. As a solutions provider, we also partner with other companies who can supplement us with the services we need to  deliver value to our customers. </p>



<p>Enter Kordia. </p>



<p>Upon our recommendation, Farro partnered with Kordia to deploy a new wide area network (WAN). The project also included a new internet connectivity and a new phone system. Watch this interview as Brent La Franchie of Kordia and Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager of Farro Fresh, as they talk about the project. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_pvqi12mkpo videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Kordia Background</h2>



<p>Brent starts off by saying, “Kordia has been around for 70 years. Kordia is known for its broadcasting capabilities, that&#8217;s where our pedigree is, and that&#8217;s where we came from.” </p>



<p>He then emphasizes the relationship Kordia and iT360 has in the past. It’s a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/case-study-farro-fresh-focus-on-customers-instead-of-security-issues-causing-inefficiencies/">recurring theme</a> that we often emphasize ourselves. </p>



<p>“iT360 Kordia actually have some personal roots that go a long way back. Our fathers worked together back in the technology age, way back in the 80s and 90s. I&#8217;m extremely proud that I can work alongside someone who my father worked alongside. We&#8217;re both very passionate about what we do. Both share a lot of the same values and we are both driven to get the same outcomes for our customers.”</p>



<h2>Security Issues That Need to Be Addressed</h2>



<p>Simon starts off by describing the security issues they were experiencing at Farro. </p>



<p>“In late 2017, we had some security issues, and our CEO, Bryce Howard had worked with iT360.” </p>



<p>The security issues faced by Farro hundred them from doing their work. As noted by Simon in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/farro-fresh-protects-digital-technologies-using-watchguard/">another video</a>, nothing’s ever been compromised, but the incursions were preventing their staff to do their job properly. </p>



<p>He goes on to continue by sharing his impressions of us during the early stages of the relationship. </p>



<p>“There was an immediate level of confidence just from meeting with the guys and talking to them about what we wanted out of the relationship and what they could bring to the table.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Brent talks more about the solution and how it was implemented&#8230;</p>



<p>“So that solution was a new wide area network, Awareness we call it. New internet connectivity, new phone system, and also some new security architecture.”</p>



<p>“One of the clear directives was how do we transition them, to this new fantastic network, without disrupting their everyday business? So between iT360 and Kordia, we implemented a network, which sat alongside their existing network infrastructure. And then once ready, we cut that network over to the new network.” </p>



<p>While this may sound simple on the surface, this involved a lot of moving parts from three different parties. Despite this, the switch was successful and didn’t create any disturbance in the operations of Farro Fresh. </p>



<h2>The Results: Simon Looks Back at the Partnership</h2>



<p>“The choice IT360 had made to partner with Kordia for us was the right one,” said Simon. “And the expertise Kordia had available was phenomenal. Throughout the whole process, we always felt that we were listened to. And the focus of my job has changed from fire fighting and repair to planning and future projects.” </p>



<p>“If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.”</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> was experiencing security issues that hindered them from serving their customers. Fed up with this, they started looking for ways to improve the security of their digital technologies. </p>



<p>When Farro approached us with this issue, we recommended to work with one of our long-time partners, WatchGuard. </p>



<p>Here’s an interview that talks about the problems Farro was having and how WatchGuard helped. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">

</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>WatchGuard Background</h2>



<p>Kurt Brandon, Sales Manager, start off by sharing some background on WatchGuard.</p>



<p>“So, WatchGuard have been in business for 20 plus years. We&#8217;re one of the original developers of hardware firewalls and our focus all those years has been the small to medium business market&#8230;Also, on distributed enterprise of which Farro comes into that market.” </p>



<h2>The Importance of Digital Technologies</h2>



<p>As with most businesses today, digital technologies is very important. Yet, most businesses aren’t thinking about how they can protect them. </p>



<p>Until something happens. </p>



<p>Simon Foley, Data and IT Man<g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="3" data-gr-id="3">a</g>ger of Farro, shares their experience with having security issues in the business and how it has impeded their ability to serve their customers. </p>



<p>“Farro is a supermarket chain. We have six stores around Auckland, about 350 staff at the moment.”</p>



<p>“Without digital technologies, we wouldn&#8217;t exist. Literally every part of the business we have, including alarms and notifications, is all about having a strong underlying, safe network.”</p>



<p>He then highlights the importance of <strong>proactively</strong> putting systems in place to protect these digital systems&#8230;</p>



<p>“Security is an ongoing concern in any company. Our business has experienced issues with security in the past, and they have impacted the business in quite some serious ways. Nothing&#8217;s ever been compromised, but it certainly had affected our ability to allow our staff to do their job properly.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Having the confidence in our IT partner to provide stuff that gives us security and confidence in our systems&#8230;[it] means that instead of spending the day worrying about what could happen, we can actually plan for the future of the business.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Early Beginnings of the Project</h2>



<p>When asked about his impressions of us, Simon says, “When we met with iT360 for the first time, in January 2018, our impressions of the guys were, that they were very professional, that they were of a size to help us, and that they had the skills and knowledge, and access to other people with their skills and knowledge, to actually provide us with the things that we were looking for.” </p>



<h2>iT360 and WatchGuard Partnership</h2>



<p>“iT360 are our long term Watchguard partner. They&#8217;ve been a gold partner for a number of years. And they also run our managed services offering,” says Kurt. </p>



<p>Having worked with WatchGuard for a long time, we are confident in their products. We also love working with them. That’s why when we were discussing the needs of Farro, we immediately know that WatchGuard is a partner we can bring in to help them with they <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security issues</a>. </p>



<p>“So when they were talking to Farro Fresh they approached me about how we would build a network for them, how we would deliver that, and from there, we viewed the compromise that they&#8217;d had and looked at how we would protect them going forward.”</p>



<h2>Future Proofing the Business</h2>



<p>After a year and a half, Farro has never encountered any security issue in their network. This eventually helped shift their perspective. Instead of worrying about security issues, they can now focus on the future. </p>



<p>“Having the confidence in our IT partner to provide stuff that gives us security and confidence in our systems&#8230;[it] means that instead of spending the day worrying about what could happen, we can actually plan for the future of the business.&#8221; </p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a>, a boutique supermarket chain, was experiencing security issues in their business. This prevented them from serving their customers fully. </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Earlier this year, we interviewed Bryce Howard, CEO of Farro Fresh, about the challenges they were facing and where they are now after working with us. </p>



<h2>Farro Fresh Background</h2>



<p>“So we&#8217;re a boutique supermarket chain that has been set up in Auckland starting about 2006. And starting from one store, small beginning, 10 people, and from there we&#8217;ve grown to six supermarkets, have about 350 full-timers, and we&#8217;re covering most of Auckland.”  </p>



<p>Bryce then goes to explain the importance of digital technology to their business&#8230;</p>



<p>“The digital technology for Farro is imperative for our business. We need a system that is both stable and operational seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and without that, we won&#8217;t have a business.” </p>



<p>And as is often the case with most New Zealand businesses, they don’t think about protecting their data and other information&#8230;until something happens. </p>



<p>“The security aspect is quite interesting. You don&#8217;t realize how important it is until you have an incursion. We&#8217;ve certainly learned the hard way, learned a couple of times that the security of the network is of utmost importance.”</p>



<p>In fact, that’s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">one of the most common myths</a> SMB owners came to believe in — “I’m a small business, no one would target me.” But as you may already know by now, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">most cyber attacks aren’t targeted</a>. </p>



<p>For example, the most common type of attack, email phishing, isn’t sent to a single person or a company. It’s sent to pretty much everyone in the cyber criminal’s database — which <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">most likely would include yours</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. </p><cite>Bryce Howard, CEO</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Importance of Relationships</h2>



<p>One of the feedback we often get from our customers is that we don’t treat them as clients; rather, treat them as family. But don’t just take our word for it. Check out our <a href="https://g.page/iT360" target="_blank">reviews on Google</a>.</p>



<p>David Wilson, iT360’s General Manager, talks about this relationship more. </p>



<p>“We came to work with Farro actually because of relationships. My father had been working with Bryce for many, many years back at Tasti Products, actually. He realized the situation of IT in the business at the time and reached out to us to help. Because of that relationship and the fact that Dad had built trust with Bryce over so many years, it just meant that Bryce could say to us, &#8220;I know you can take care of this job, and I trust you.&#8221; </p>



<h2>Systems Thinking vs Bandaid Solution</h2>



<p>We’ve been in the business for <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">over 25 years</a>. We’ve had our share of comments and feedback from various customers across different industries. </p>



<p>One of the most common issue we often hear is service providers (like us) often recommend solutions to fix the symptoms. And as you already know, targeting the symptoms vs the underlying solutions isn’t a good strategy. While it does seem ok in the short-term, eventually, this creates more problems for the business. </p>



<p>That’s why we always make sure we understand the situation fully before recommending something. </p>



<p>And that was the same thing with Farro. </p>



<p>Dave goes on to continue, “it was a business that actually needed something done in almost every area of IT, and we managed to achieve the entire project in a very, very short window of time, without impacting any operations.” </p>



<p>Recommending one thing might make the problem go away temporarily. But without a systemic approach, that problem will continue to rear its ugly head. </p>



<h2>Focus on Customers Instead of Internal Issues</h2>



<p>When asked about the results of working with iT360, Bryce said “For me, the key proof in the pudding is the fact that we don&#8217;t have to keep on thinking about the safety, security, or access of our computers.”</p>



<p>And that’s one of the criteria every supplier or vendor should be weighed against — do they allow you to focus on your core business instead of constantly putting out fires? Are the systems running and working the way they should? Or do these issues continue coming up? </p>



<p>Bryce continues, “We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. We&#8217;re continuing to have a great relationship and a great outcome from working with iT360.”</p>

<p>Let’s face it. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> isn’t the sexiest topic out there. But, as we rely on the internet more each day — our phones, computers, and other appliances at home and work — you cannot take online security for granted. </p>



<p>That’s why we curated the best videos we can find on cyber security which are at the same time, not boring. </p>



<h2>4 Cyber Security Videos That Are Not Boring</h2>



<h3>1. How cyber security would look like in real life</h3>



<p>When people think cyber security, they often don’t associate it being in the “real world.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s only on the internet, right? It can’t affect me.</p></blockquote>



<p>That’s why it is often difficult to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">understand what these terms are and what they mean</a>. </p>



<p>Watch this video to find out how cyber security would look like in real life…</p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1b8865GOHU?start=82" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<h3>2. Are your passwords secure? </h3>



<p>“What’s the password to your email”</p>



<p>“Not even a clue? Is it a combination of your birthday? Does it have your pet’s name on it? Great. </p>



<p>“When’s your birthday? What’s the name of your pet? </p>



<p>“Thanks. So, I now have your email password…</p>



<p>Watch this funny video to see how people willingly give out their passwords to strangers on the street. </p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6492404284917977088" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="504" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<p>But kidding aside, you should seriously consider using strong and unique passwords and multi-factor authentication. Want to learn more? Join our 4-day email series on how to do that exactly. </p>

<h3>3. Theft in the 21th century</h3>



<p>You’ve bought a brand new and sophisticated car. You’ve installed CCTV cameras and home security software. </p>



<p>You’re safe from robbers, right? </p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6522428358465245184?compact=1" allowfullscreen="" width="504" height="284" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<h3>4. Cyber security starts at the top</h3>



<p>Ready to take cyber security seriously? </p>



<p>As with every implementation, cyber security has to start at the top! </p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6523545851179134976?compact=1" allowfullscreen="" width="504" height="284" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Cyber security is real. Cyber criminals are real. And it’s no longer confined to the “internet.” <br>As technology improves and permeates our everyday lives, it’s best to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">stop treating cyber risk as a separate type of risk</a>. </p>

<p>Getting hacked is one of the things you often hear in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.hiscox.co.uk/sites/uk/files/documents/2018-02/Hiscox_Cyber_Readiness_Report_2018_FINAL.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 report</a>, 73% of businesses are not ready to respond to a cyber attack. </p>



<p>That means getting hacked is now a matter of <em>when</em>, not if.</p>



<p>But it doesn’t have to come to that. </p>



<p>There are a lot of things you can do to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">protect yourself from getting hacked</a>. You have to equip yourself with <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">basic cyber security terminologies</a>. Then, when you’re familiar, dive right in into our <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">non-technical guide to protecting your business online</a>. </p>



<p>But you may be asking… </p>



<h2>What Happens When You Get Hacked</h2>



<p>Getting hacked can mean a lot of things for different people. That’s why a lot of people still don’t take their online security seriously. </p>



<p>In this article, we’ve broken it down according to the levels of severity/effect on the victim.</p>



<p>Below are the five levels of hacking and what you can do to prevent it from happening. </p>



<h3>Level 1: Harmless Snooping </h3>



<p>The first level of hacking is when someone gains access to your data or information and does nothing about it. </p>



<p>For example, someone behind you at the train is ‘reading’ your email at the same time as you. Or someone who heard a private conversation you had with your spouse. Or a person who visited your office and saw some documents lying around…</p>



<p>This level doesn’t do any harm because the <em>unauthorized person</em> doesn’t do anything with the information. They just kept it to themselves and went about their regular day. Maybe they just used it as an interesting conversation over dinner with their spouse later that day. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 1 hacking</h4>



<p>This level won’t cause much harm, but if the person has some evil intentions, then it’s worth taking extra precautions. </p>



<p>If you’re worried about someone snooping around reading your phone or your computer in a cafe, the best way to avoid that is to <strong>position yourself with your back against the wall</strong>. That way, no one can see what’s on your screen. </p>



<p>Or if that’s not possible, use one of those screen filters that block viewing from certain angles. Meaning, only the person who is directly in front can see what’s on the screen. </p>



<p>Still can’t visualize this? Next time you go to the ATM, step a little to the left/right and try looking at it from the side instead of the front. You should not see anything on the screen. It&#8217;s going to be the same thing but for your devices. </p>



<h3>Level 2: The Prank</h3>



<p>The second level of hacking is when your data is used against you but in a harmless, light-hearted way. You know, the one you just laugh and tell stories about later.</p>



<p>Imagine drinking out with your buddies. You tell stories. You laugh. After a while, you go to the bathroom. Then, when you come back, you notice everyone chuckling. You keep asking why and they won’t tell you. You let it go. </p>



<p>Then, you check your phone. You saw Facebook has a ton of notifications. When you looked at it, everyone at the table suddenly burst into laughter. You then looked at it and one of your buddies posted something. </p>



<p>No harm done. Just your drunk buddies playing a prank on you. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 2 hacking</h4>



<p>If you haven’t already, <strong>add a passcode to your devices</strong>. Make it a habit to <em>lock</em> it before leaving it — whether that’s your phone or your computer. </p>



<p>Your password is useless if the device is already open. </p>



<p>For Mac users running on the latest OS (Mojave), simply press ‘command + ctrl + Q’ at the same time to lock your screen. If you’re using Windows 10, just press the ‘windows button + L’ to lock your screen. </p>



<p>And this goes without saying, if it’s portable enough, like your phone or tablet, and you’re in a public place like a cafe, please don’t leave it at the table when you go to the restroom, or order your drink. </p>



<h3>Level 3: Fraud</h3>



<p>Level 3 hacking is when the information accessed/stolen is used against you. This is the typical hacking you hear on the news where the hacker used the credit card of another person, or through other methods such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#phishing">phishing</a> or <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/#ransomware">ransomware</a>. </p>



<p>Remember, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">70% of small and medium businesses have been targeted by a cyber attack</a>. So, don’t take this for granted. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 3 hacking</h4>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">General rules for protecting yourself online</a> applies here:</p>



<ul><li>Don’t open emails/links from someone you don’t know</li><li>Use strong and unique passwords</li><li>Use a multi-factor authentication</li><li>Use a VPN</li><li>Don’t connect to public Wi-Fis (if possible) </li></ul>



<p>Remember that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">technology</a> such as antivirus software can only protect you to an extent. You also have to do your part. </p>



<h3>Level 4: Breach</h3>



<p>Level 4 hacking goes beyond financial harm. Usually, the victim’s reputation takes a hit. It’s when other people are also affected in some way. </p>



<p>Remember the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/icloud-hacking-not-just-for-celebrities/">iCloud hacking of celebrities</a> that happened before? This can also happen to you. </p>



<p>Or if you’re a business, this will be the data breaches where your customers’ sensitive information is leaked to the public — leading to the<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/"> loss of trust of your customers</a>. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 4 hacking</h4>



<p>Preventing a level 4 hack starts at the <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/">top of your organization</a>. You have to know who are the most common targets and how to spot them in their tracks. </p>



<p>Then, a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-create-an-it-policy/">cyber security policy</a> is also key. You can’t expect your employees to know what you know, or even think about their online habits and how it may affect the entire organization. It’s up to you to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">communicate cyber security with your staff</a>. </p>



<h3>Level 5: Physical Harm</h3>



<p>Level 5 hacking is the most severe type because it causes physical harm to people. Unlike money which you can earn back later or reputational harm which you can repair over time, this type of hacking can lead to irreversible consequences such as injuries or death. </p>



<p>This is the type that you often see on movies where hackers cause sudden blackouts leading to chaos or hack into your cars to control them. </p>



<p>Still not convinced? Here’s a<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/physical-damage-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> list of cyber security attacks</a> that happened already resulting to physical harm, including tampering of HVAC systems in a hospital and the main control software of a German plant that resulted to a physical blast. </p>



<h4>How to prevent level 5 hacking</h4>



<p>Preventing this level of hacking is similar to the ones described above. It takes just one mistake (a single infected USB thumb drive or an innocent click on an email) to allow hackers to get in your system. </p>



<p>If your organization doesn’t have the necessary skills or manpower to handle your cyber security, your best course of action is to <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/free-consult-booking/">hire an external IT partner</a> to assess your current state and work together to ensure you are ready for a cyber attack. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There’s a lot you can do to protect yourself from getting hacked. </p>



<p><strong>Remember, if something can connect to the internet, it can be hacked. </strong></p>



<p>No technology is 100% hack-proof. </p>



<p>You (and your employees) are the last line of defence when it comes to not getting hacked. </p>



<p>So, the question is, are you ready when that happens?</p>

<div class="rank-math-list ">
<div id="faq-question-5fe4edba6cd1b" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What is malware?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Malware comes from <strong>ma</strong>licious soft<strong>ware</strong>. It&#8217;s the generic term for viruses, worms, and other software designed to gain unauthorized access or cause damage to a computer. Think of it as whiskey and Scotch, or Champagne and sparkling wines. All Scotch are whiskey, but not all whiskey are Scotch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-5fe4edba6cd1e" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What is ransomware?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents you from accessing your files until a ransom is paid. They do this by encrypting your files and asking for money. What that means is they add passwords to them. Since you don’t know the password and you obviously need to access your files,  you’d be left with no choice but to pay the hacker.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-5fe4edba6cd20" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What is two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>2FA or MFA adds another layer of security to your accounts. That can be two (2FA) or more (MFA) depending on what you use. For example, before you can login your email, you need a password (first layer). If you have MFA enabled, it will also ask for a code (second layer) to be added. This code usually comes from an app or an SMS message. This means you need your phone with you (third layer). </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-5fe4edba6cd21" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What is the difference between two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA)?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is a form of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The determining attribute here is that MFAs means two or more ways to protect your account. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="faq-question-5fe4edba6cd22" class="rank-math-list-item">
<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What is the cloud?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>The cloud is a technology that allows you to access our files and/or services through the internet from anywhere in the world. Technically speaking, it’s a collection of computers with large storage capabilities that remotely serve requests. </p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<h3 id="malware">1. Malware</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/malware-definition-1024x512.png" alt="malware definition" class="wp-image-3368" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 6"></figure>



<p>Malware is short for <strong>mal</strong>icious soft<strong>ware</strong>. It is any software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer. It’s also the <em>general</em> (umbrella) term for all forms of malicious software. </p>



<p>Think of it as whiskey and Scotch, or Champagne and sparkling wines. </p>



<ul><li>All Scotch are whiskeys, but not all whiskeys are Scotch. </li><li>All Champagne is sparkling wines, but not all sparkling wines are Champagne. </li></ul>



<p>For it to be called Scotch or Champagne, they have to come from Scotland and Champagne, France directly. </p>



<p>It’s the same way for malware. These viruses and worms are all malware. </p>



<h3 id="ransomware">2. Ransomware</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ransomware-definition-1024x512.png" alt="ransomware definition" class="wp-image-3369" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 7"></figure>



<p>Ransomware is a type of malware that prevents you from accessing files on your computer until a ransom is paid. They do this by <em>encrypting</em> your files. What that means is they add passwords to it. Hacker then asks for money in exchange for the decryption key (password). Since you don’t know the password and you obviously need to access your files, you’d be left with no choice but to pay the hacker. </p>



<p>It’s like your typical hostage situation where the hostage taker is holding someone hostage. The demands are to pay the ransom to release the hostage. Once you pay, they release the person. </p>



<p>Here, the hacker is holding your data hostage. Once you pay the ransom, they’ll give you back your data (by giving the password to access it).</p>



<h3 id="social-engineering">3. Social Engineering</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/social-engineering-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Social Engineering Definition" class="wp-image-3388" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 8"></figure>



<p>Social engineering is a tactic that aims to convince a user to disclose sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers by impersonating other people. The most common social engineering example involves someone posing as the CEO and sends an email to the accounting/finance department to transfer money to a “supplier.” </p>



<p>For more information on this and how you can prevent your business from being targeted, download this free eBook on<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/"> Who Are Your Organisation’s Top Targets?</a></p>



<h3 id="phishing">4. Phishing</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/phishing-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Phishing Definition" class="wp-image-3389" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 9"></figure>



<p>Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails (or any other communication platform like SMS or calls) that resemble messages coming from reputable sources with the intention of stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/qD50Nl-S3TsXGjBLWDFOBig-Nycbxa70lXj4rxlboD--Gpz3XA46zRyhcb530uWa499FHJ9H7zkMOTC8PuvF6Nzzk37II6wq510cyx0FpA6t_cH2fNzuqXq8qyJnfLdUZS4KP76UkQl4DHvNPA" alt="sample phishing email" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 10"></figure>



<p>Here’s an example of a phishing email where someone is pretending to be Apple. But if you look closely, you’d notice there are signs these are fake. For example, the email address contains a string of letters. Their domain is from akicintaopan.com, and not apple.com. And what might be the biggest factor, at least for me, is that Apple ID isn’t using this email address. </p>



<h3 id="vulnerability">5. Vulnerability</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vulnerability-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Vulnerability Definition" class="wp-image-3391" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 11"></figure>



<p>A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control. What this means is if one of the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">three pillars of cyber security</a> is not addressed, your business is vulnerable. </p>



<p>You can think of vulnerabilities as weaknesses that you can take advantage of. For example, in football, you generally attack where there’s no defense present. If everyone is on the right side of the field, make a cross towards the left side and you have better chances of scoring a goal. </p>



<h3 id="denial-of-service">6. Denial-of-service (DoS)</h3>



<p>DoS attacks are designed to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users. This is usually done by one computer. There’s a version of this called Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) which uses multiple computers to do the same thing. </p>



<p>Watch this quick video to show you what this might look like in real life. For more context, you can watch the entire clip. </p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1b8865GOHU?start=82" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<h3 id="spoofing">7. Spoofing</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spoofing-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Spoofing Definition" class="wp-image-3392" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 12"></figure>



<p>Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain. </p>



<p>This is similar to phishing in the sense that hackers try to deceive the person receiving it, but the main difference is that spoofing is for delivery whereas phishing is for retrieval. </p>



<p>You won’t knowingly download a malware, right? But if someone tricked you into clicking a link, say about your business getting sued, you will most likely click on it. That will then lead to a download of some sort of malware.</p>



<h3 id="adware">8. Adware</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/adware-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Adware Definition" class="wp-image-3393" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 13"></figure>



<p>Adware is a form of malware that hides on your device and serves you advertisements. Some adware also monitors your behavior online so it can target you with specific ads.</p>



<p>Kaspersky recently wrote an article about a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/adware-in-chrome-extensions/25668/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now-removed Chrome extension</a> that started out as a regular plugin but became an adware — delivering unwanted ads every now and then. </p>



<p>While not outright malicious, meaning it doesn’t corrupt your date (like ransomware) or steal it (spyware), it’s very annoying. And the ads that appear might lead you to eventually download other types of malware. </p>



<h3 id="spyware">9. Spyware</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/spyware-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Spyware Definition" class="wp-image-3394" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 14"></figure>



<p>Spyware is a form of malware that hides on your device, monitors your activity, and steals sensitive information like bank details and passwords.</p>



<p>You can think of this as “Big Brother” but in a bad way. Everything you do — what you watch and what you type — gets monitored. If you login your bank and didn’t have multi-factor authentication, someone can easily access your money. </p>



<h3 id="trojan">10. Trojan</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/trojan-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Trojan Definition" class="wp-image-3395" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 15"></figure>



<p>Trojans are programs that claim to perform one function but actually do another, typically malicious. Trojans can take the form of attachments, downloads, and fake videos/programs.</p>



<p>While there are <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-malware-what-is-a-trojan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many types of trojans</a>, the concept is simple. Hackers try to get in your computers by promising to do something (fake program), but later does something else (give them access to your system). </p>



<p>Remember the story of Troy and how the Greeks lay ruin to the walled city? </p>



<p>After years of war, the Greeks created the Trojan Horse, sailed away, and left one man behind. This man convinced the people of Troy that they abandoned him and left the horse as an offering to the goddess Athena. The Trojans pulled the horse back into Troy. Later that night, a small Greek army emerged from inside the horse and opened the gates for the rest of the Greek army (which sailed back under during the night) to enter; thus, destroying the city of Troy and ending the war. </p>



<h3 id="keylogger">11. Keylogger</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/keylogger-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Keylogger Definition" class="wp-image-3396" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 16"></figure>



<p>Keyloggers secretly record what you see, say and do on your computer. Employers use keyloggers to watch employees, but cybercriminals use them too.</p>



<p>Keyloggers lies on the border of a productivity tool and a spyware. The main difference is where the data is used. Take, for example, this <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2017/08/03/fired-employee-caught-by-keylogger-wins-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">employee who sued his employer for illegal dismissal</a>. </p>



<h3 id="mfa">12. Two-Factor Authentication / Multi-Factor Authentication </h3>



<p>Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is a form of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). The determining attribute here is that MFAs mean two or more ways to protect your account. </p>



<p>Do you use an ATM to access your cash? If you do, then you’re already using a form of multi-factor authentication. </p>



<p>In order to withdraw your cash, you would need the following:</p>



<ol><li>Your ATM card</li><li>Your PIN</li></ol>



<p>That’s an added layer of security banks (and other services you use) to protect you. If you lost your wallet, someone can easily withdraw from your account if you don’t have a PIN. </p>



<h3 id="cloud">13. Cloud</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cloud-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Cloud  Definition" class="wp-image-3397" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 17"></figure>



<p>A technology that allows us to access our files and/or services through the internet from anywhere in the world. Technically speaking, it’s a collection of computers with large storage capabilities that remotely serve requests.</p>



<p>Steve Jobs said in a 2011 Keynote, “Some people think the cloud is just a hard drive in the sky. We think it&#8217;s way more than that…everything happens automatically and there’s nothing new to learn…it just works.” </p>



<p>You can watch the video below…</p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zNgPQCH8UA" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<p>While he talked about their product, iCloud, the <em>cloud</em> works in the same way. It works in the background to help you do what you need to do. </p>



<h3 id="software">14. Software</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/software-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Software Definition" class="wp-image-3398" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 18"></figure>



<p>A set of programs that tell a computer to perform a task. These instructions are compiled into a package that users can install and use. For example, Microsoft Office is an application software.</p>



<p>A simple way to think of software is it’s what you interact with on your devices. The apps on your phone are all software. The <em>programs</em> you are using on your laptops and computers are software. </p>



<h3 id="vpn">15. Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h3>



<p>A virtual private network (VPN) is a tool that allows you to remain anonymous while using the internet. It does this by masking your location and encrypting your traffic. </p>



<p>Take a look at this image…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/a4Cl4hQsWat74a8MOSnUdyyomU3Inayf1wWUF2g0R5wGUzeINAfqndvc6KFmNuTFLW_TLBIrUaEwXg1F6SY2ZyuM-1OZQmdM8LMVmncfCcyiI25UxOm8WTUWh8siAuHRzlJnKKbRFTtuGrd-oQ" alt="How VPN Works" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 19"></figure>



<p>When you connect to the internet, it goes through a series of steps that happens behind the scenes. </p>



<ul><li>From your device, it goes to a router (whether public or private)</li><li>From that router, it heads to your internet service provider (ISP)</li><li>From your ISP, it reaches the <em>internet</em></li></ul>



<p>As the image depicts, with VPN, the <em>data</em> gets encrypted the moment it leaves your device. No one can snoop around wherever they are. </p>



<h3 id="encryption">16. Encryption</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/encryption-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Encryption Definition" class="wp-image-3399" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 20"></figure>



<p>Encryption, in its simplest form, is to add a password to your data so that anyone who doesn’t know the password (called the decryption key), can’t view it. This doesn’t mean that the encrypted data can’t be stolen, though. </p>



<p>One example of this is adding a passcode to your phone. Without that passcode, your phone (and all data in it) is encrypted. Even if your phone is stolen, without them knowing that code, they won’t be able to access the contents. </p>



<h3 id="data-breach">17. Data Breach</h3>



<p>A data breach is the moment information is accessed without authorization. This includes both external and internal actors (yes, these are employees). </p>



<p>For example, the biggest data breach that welcomed the 2019 is called <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1</a>, where over 1.2 billion unique combination of email addresses and passwords were leaked to the public. </p>



<h3 id="firewall">18. Firewall</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/firewall-definition-1024x512.png" alt="Firewall Definition" class="wp-image-3400" title="21 Cyber Security Terms Business Owners Need to Know (Including Analogies to Help You Understand Them Better) 21"></figure>



<p>A firewall is a hardware or software designed to filter traffic coming in and out of your network or computer. That filter is based on a set of security rules. </p>



<p>You can think of the firewall as similar to the immigration services. People coming in/out of the country passes through a set of protocols. They can’t just allow people to come in without visas or going through a certain process. </p>



<h3 id="ip">19. IP Address</h3>



<p>An IP address, short for internet protocol address, is an internet version of a home address for your computer, which is identified when it communicates over a network. </p>



<p>There are two versions of IP addresses used today: IPv4 and IPv6. Here are examples for each version, respectively: 172.16.254.1 and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1. </p>



<p>Again, you can think of this as your home address. Your address allows people to go to your home. Or, it allows maps to determine your location and come up with the best driving route. </p>



<p>This is why a VPN is important because without it, you and your location will be sent to anyone who knows your IP address. </p>



<h3 id="virus">20. Virus</h3>



<p>A virus is a type of malware aimed to corrupt, erase or modify information on a computer before spreading to others. </p>



<p><em>See also worm below</em></p>



<h3 id="worm">21. Worm</h3>



<p>A worm is piece of malware that can replicate itself in order to spread the infection to other connected computers. It’s also a type of a virus. </p>



<p>Viruses and worms both have the ability to propagate and spread to other devices. The main difference between them is that a virus needs a a program (e.g. a word document) to cause damage whereas a worm doesn’t. </p>



<p>Do you remember the Friends episode where Chandler borrows Ross’ laptop to check his email? After clicking on the ‘photo’ that was sent by someone he didn’t know, it erased the laptop’s entire hard drive. That’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kournikova_(computer_virus)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example of a worm</a>. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>There are a lot more cyber security terms out there. Some organizations even have their own A to Z dictionary of these. Here, we only listed the most common terms you will moist likely encounter. </p>



<p>Did the analogies help you understand them better? Did we miss anything? Let us know in the comments below. <br></p>

<p>Business owners often cringe when they hear “cyber security” because it’s something that is very complicated.</p>



<p>But, it doesn’t have to be.</p>



<p>In this article, we’ll explain what cyber security is all about, why you should take it seriously, and how you can protect your company’s important and sensitive information.</p>

<h2 id="what">What Is Cyber Security</h2>



<p><strong>Cyber security is the practice of protecting computer systems</strong> — including but not limited to computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, programs, networks — from theft or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data.</p>



<p>Other people also call this information technology security or electronic information security; or simply information security. </p>



<p>Another simple definition for cyber security is that it’s the <strong>protection of internet-connected systems</strong>, including hardware, software and data, from digital attacks.</p>



<h2 id="why">Why You Should Care About Cyber Security</h2>



<p>According to a report by HP, <a href="https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/almost-half-of-nz-businesses-unprepared-for-data-breaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of New Zealand Businesses aren’t prepared for a Cyber Attack</a>.</p>



<p>The reality is, more than <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">70% small and medium businesses have been targeted by a cyber attack</a>. The scary part is that most of them don’t even know they’ve been attacked, or worse, breached — meaning, someone was able to access confidential and sensitive information of your business.</p>



<p>Now, you’re probably asking…</p>

<h3>What Happens When You Get Hacked</h3>



<p>There’s not really a straight-forward answer to this question, because there are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked/">different types of hacking</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, it can be as simple as someone posting a tweet using your business account saying “I got hacked by (blank).”</p>



<p>Or it can be very serious like adding passwords to all your files which leads to you not being able to access them (since you don’t know the password). You will then have to get in touch with the hacker to pay them a huge amount of money. Then they will send the <em>password</em> that will allow you to regain access to all your files.</p>



<p>This is an example of <strong>ransomware</strong>. It’s one of the most common types of cyber attack, which we’ll cover below.</p>



<p>Another type of hacking that has bigger repercussions is when personal information is leaked. This includes social media information, address, and job info like what happened in the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">PDL data breach</a>. </p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Because when personal data is leaked, we&#8217;re now talking about your physical security. When hackers gain access to your internet banking credentials, it&#8217;s only your money that is at risk. You can always earn it back. But when your physical safety is at risk, lives are at stake. </p>



<p>Consider the effects of these actions on your business:</p>



<h4><strong>Problem 1</strong>: Without the ability to access your data, your organization stops working.</h4>



<p>If you and your employees can’t connect to the internet or access your data, your organization stops working.</p>



<h4><strong>Problem 2</strong>: If organizational data gets breached/stolen, it can cost a huge amount of money and create animosity in the eyes of your customers.</h4>



<p>It’s only the first quarter in 2019, these types of news won’t stop soon.</p>



<h3>Costs of Cyber Attacks You’re Probably Not Aware Of</h3>



<p>When your business is involved in a data breach, two things happen:</p>



<ol><li>You lose revenues</li><li>You spend more</li></ol>



<p>The first downside of getting breached is you <strong>lose the trust of your customers</strong> (and would-be customers). This leads to lost revenues for your business. Apart from that, you’d have to <strong>spend more</strong> to recover what was lost in terms of salaries and fees, not to mention the penalties you may pay.</p>



<p>With lost revenues and added costs, that puts a big dent on your company’s profitability. And if you’re a small company without deep pockets, a cyber attack might put you out of business. </p>



<p>According to one <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/13/cyberattacks-cost-small-companies-200k-putting-many-out-of-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, over 60% of SMBs close shop within 6 months after a data breach and is <a href="https://www.hiscox.com/documents/2019-Hiscox-Cyber-Readiness-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">costing businesses $200,000 on average</a>—which includes lost business, regulatory fines, and remediation costs</p>

<h2 id="crucial-areas">7 Crucial Areas of Cyber Security You Need to Consider in Your Business</h2>



<p>Ensuring cyber security requires the coordination of efforts throughout an information system, which includes the following categories:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Network security</strong> is the process of securing a computer network from intruders, from both <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">direct and indirect attacks</a>.</li><li><strong>Application security</strong> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-data-stealing-android-malware-infiltrated-the-google-play-store-infecting-users-in-196-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compromised application</a> could provide access to the data of its users (and your business.</li><li><strong>Information security</strong> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit. This includes <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">protecting your backups</a> as well.</li><li><strong>Operational security</strong> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.</li><li><strong>Disaster recovery and business continuity</strong> dictate how your business gets back on its feet and restore operations should a disaster or a cyber security breach that caused data loss occur.</li><li><strong>End-user education</strong> addresses the most unpredictable cyber security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Phishing attacks are the most common threat your staff should be knowledgeable about.</li><li><strong>Leadership commitment</strong> is the key to the successful implementation of any cyber security project. Without it, it is very difficult to establish, implement and maintain effective processes.</li></ol>



<p>One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the <strong>constantly evolving nature</strong> of security risks. This is also the main reason why there’s a shortage of talent in the industry.</p>



<p>And the main reason why you should have a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/free-consult-booking/">reliable IT partner</a> to stay on top of all these changes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/people-pointing-to-laptop-screen-1024x683.jpg" alt="important areas in cyber security no one is talking about" width="512" height="342" title="Cyber Security 101: A Guide to Protecting Your Business Online 23"></figure></div>



<h2>Two Additional Areas of Cyber Security No One Is Talking About</h2>



<h3>1. Mobile security</h3>



<p>Modern businesses are powered by a mobile workforce. As a business owner, you’re always on the go. You’re with your phone 24/7, talking to your customers, chatting with your team, accessing files and emails, and much more.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s vital that you keep your phone (and your employee’s devices) protected — both physically and digitally.</p>



<p>Start by adding a password/passcode to your devices. For ease of use, there are people who still don’t use them. Also, consider using a VPN, especially when using your device to connect to public Wi-Fis.</p>



<p>There have been cases where personal devices were the cause of security breaches. Even without any malicious intent, an employee may plug in a personal USB to bring in some documents to finish over the weekend can become the reason why your business gets hacked. </p>



<h3>2. Internet-of-things (IoT) security</h3>



<p>Technology is continuously making our lives easier and simpler. And it definitely is <em>invading </em>our homes and offices — from as simple as an automatic garage door opener, to the temperature control in your living room, to speakers that can play music and even make orders online; or smart printers where you just send an email to a specific address and it prints out automatically, or programmable coffee machines.</p>



<p>All these are conveniences brought about by technology.</p>



<p>However, they are not without risks. Unlike our computers, IoT devices do not have anti-virus software as their first line of defense.  </p>



<p>If these devices don’t have updated security protocols, a hacker can easily get in and gain access to all your devices. They can see you in your own CCTV, hear you in your speakers, and everything else you see in movies.</p>



<p>That’s why it’s important to keep yourself protected. The best way to do this is to <strong>update your software/firmware</strong> and <strong>add passwords</strong> to your devices.</p>



<p>For more tips on how to protect yourself, read this article on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">how to avoid getting hacked</a>.</p>



<h2 id="pillars">3 Pillars of Cyber Security You Need to Focus On</h2>



<p>If you’re keen on understanding and implementing cyber security for your business, there are three areas (or pillars) you need to look into: people, processes and technology.</p>



<p>This three-pronged approach helps organisations defend themselves from both organised attacks and common internal threats, such as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">accidental breaches and human error</a>.</p>



<h3>1. Technology</h3>



<p><strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">Technology</a></strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/"> encompasses both software and hardware</a>. The most common one you are probably using is antivirus software. But, as you may probably know, none of these is perfect. Some <em>will</em> get through the cracks. That&#8217;s why the other two pillars are important. </p>



<h3>2. Processes</h3>



<p>Processes are your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/no-cyber-security-policy/">policies</a> and how you company deals with online security and protection. This includes:</p>



<ul><li>How you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">protect and backup your data</a>, </li><li>BYOD policies (Bring Your Own Device), </li><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-steps-to-help-you-recover-from-targeted-cyber-attack/">What you do in the event of a breach</a>, and </li><li>How you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">communicate cyber security to your staff</a></li></ul>



<h3>3. People</h3>



<p>According to one study, people have a contribution to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">96% of all breaches</a>. Without any <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyberwise-free-trial/">continuous education on best practices</a>, your organisation could be next. Learn the most <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/organisation-phishing-targets/">common targets in your organisation</a> and how you can avoid them.</p>

<h2 id="common-threats">Most Common Cyber Security Threats to Your Business</h2>



<h3>1. Malware</h3>



<p>Malware, short for <em>mal</em>icious soft<em>ware</em>, is any software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer. It’s the <em>general</em> term for viruses, trojans, etc.</p>



<h3>2. Ransomware</h3>



<p>Ransomware is a type of malware designed to extort money by blocking access to files/computers until <em>ransom</em> is paid. This is the example we wrote above. In a recent attack, <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/6-things-to-know-about-the-ransomware-that-hit-norsk-hydro/d/d-id/1334270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ransomware caused this company over $40m already</a>.</p>



<h3>3. Social Engineering</h3>



<p>Social engineering is a tactic that aims to convince a user to disclose sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers by impersonating other people. The most common social engineering example involves someone posing as the CEO and sends an email to the accounting/finance department to transfer money to a “supplier.”</p>



<h3>4. Phishing</h3>



<p>Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails (or any other communication platform like SMS or calls) that resemble messages coming from reputable sources with the intention of stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/woman-having-coffee-while-reading-on-laptop-1024x683.jpg" alt="learn cyber security while on your break" width="512" height="342" title="Cyber Security 101: A Guide to Protecting Your Business Online 24"></figure></div>



<h2 id="terms">7 Most Common Cyber Security Terms You Need to Know</h2>



<p>Apart from the most common threats you may face in your business, there are other <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">cyber security terms</a> you need to be familiar with. These terms are often in news sites. A better understanding will greatly help you reduce the risks to you and your business.</p>



<h3>1. Vulnerability</h3>



<p>A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control.</p>



<p><em>Remember the 3 pillars of cyber security above? If one of them, say your technology, isn’t updated, a hacker can easily get in your systems. </em></p>



<h3>2. Denial-of-service (DoS)</h3>



<p>DoS attacks are designed to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users.</p>



<p><em>This is </em><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/toyota-cyber-attack-leaves-employees-unable-to-access-emails-for-days-20190221-p50z70.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>what happened to Toyota</em></a><em> last February where the staff can’t access their emails for days. </em></p>



<h3>3. Spoofing</h3>



<p>Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.</p>



<p><em>This is similar to phishing in the sense that hackers try to deceive the person receiving it, but the main difference is that spoofing is for delivery whereas phishing is for retrieval. You won’t knowingly download a malware, right? But if someone tricked you into clicking a link, say about your business getting sued, you will most likely click on it. That will then lead to a download of some sort of malware. </em></p>



<h3>4. Adware</h3>



<p>Adware is a form of malware, malicious or not, that hides on your device and displays advertisements on a computer. Some adware also monitors your behavior online so it can target you with specific ads.</p>



<p><em>A common sign that you have adware is when your browser’s homepage changes into something else, i.e. when you open it, a website automatically loads instead of your default page. </em></p>



<h3>5. Spyware</h3>



<p>Spyware is a form of malware that hides on your device, monitors your activity, and steals sensitive information like bank details and passwords.</p>



<p><em>One example of spyware is a keystroke logger, or keylogger (see below).</em></p>



<h3>6. Keylogger</h3>



<p>Keyloggers secretly records what you <em>type</em> on your computers and devices. Employers use keyloggers to watch employees, but cybercriminals use them too.</p>



<p><em>On its own, you can track productivity levels and what people do, but when used maliciously, you can steal credit card information and other sensitive data. </em></p>



<h3>7. Trojan</h3>



<p>Trojans are software programs that claims to do A, but does B instead. They can take the form of attachments, downloads, and fake videos/programs.</p>



<p><em>Taking its name from the Greek Mythology, the trojan horse allows a hacker to get into your system by promising to do one thing (offering to Athena), but also allowing the hacker to do other things (get inside Troy).</em></p>
