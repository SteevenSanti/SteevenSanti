<p>Not all antivirus software is created equal. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> is an area that is constantly evolving, that is why technology such as antivirus software should be able to adapt to these changes. Below, we outline five signs it might be time to upgrade your protection. </p>



<h2>5 Signs You Need a New Antivirus Software</h2>



<h3>1. Your business is growing</h3>



<p>If business is booming, then first off – congratulations! But before you pop the champagne and start celebrating, it’s important to make sure that your security software can scale with your business as it grows. The larger your organisation gets, the more protection it will need to <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">keep sensitive information safe</a>.  </p>



<p>This is especially true if you’re hiring more employees and expanding your computer network. As more people enter the network, the higher the chances of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">systems being hacked or information going missing</a>. For peace of mind that your antivirus software can adequately protect your booming business, ask your provider, consult an IT specialist, or start shopping around for new products. </p>



<h3>2. You’re using a free product</h3>



<p>There are several free antivirus software products available online.  These can be a great option for budget-conscious individuals (after all,  something is better than nothing), but most businesses require more robust protection. Free software may have served you well as a solopreneur, but if your business is expanding, it’s probably time for an upgrade. </p>



<h3>3. You don’t know what your software &#8216;does&#8217;</h3>



<p>Many people treat antivirus software as a ‘set-and-forget’ tool,  trusting that it will automatically run in the background and alert you if anything is amiss. </p>



<p>While this is true for some products, it’s good practice to understand how the software works and to make sure you are maximising it to its full potential. You may be missing out on key security features, or worse, overlooking problematic threats. Consider reading these <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">15 cyber security myths you should stop believing in 2019</a>. </p>



<h3>4. You’ve had a virus since installing the software</h3>



<p> If your computer has been affected by a virus since installing an antivirus product, then this could be a telltale sign that your software is not up to the task. Perhaps it’s not sophisticated enough? Or maybe it’s not being updated on a regular basis? </p>



<p>Try to identify the cause of the virus and see if you can avoid the same problem occurring again with new antivirus software. </p>

<h3>5. You’re using outdated software</h3>



<p>Viruses and hackers are evolving at an extraordinary pace, and the only way to stay one step ahead of them is to make sure your cyber security strategy is as up-to-date as possible. This means using antivirus software by a reputable provider who is constantly enhancing the product to keep out new threats as they arise.  </p>



<p>If your software is outdated, it won’t stand a chance against sophisticated malware. </p>



<p>One of the best antivirus products on the market is <a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-products/security-services/gateway-antivirus?referral=it360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gateway Antivirus</a>,  developed by WatchGuard. Offering full integration with other WatchGuard security applications, Gateway Antivirus can be customised to <strong>suit your business and includes cutting-edge features such as flexible </strong>administrator control and compressed file scanning. </p>



<p><strong>Business leaders need to realise that cyber security is a big deal. It affects reputation, internal communication and even company culture.
