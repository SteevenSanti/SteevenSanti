										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We’ve talked a lot about&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;here on our blog and our social media accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why? Because it’s really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet most business leaders still don’t put too much thought into how they can protect their business. Most of them still believe in&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">cyber security myths</a>&nbsp;like “we’re just a small business, we won’t be targeted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you didn’t already know, the vast majority of cyber attacks aren’t targeted. Meaning, whether you’re a large corporation with thousands of employees or a small business with just one staff, you can still fall victim to a cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cyber criminals don’t discriminate</strong>!&nbsp;</p>

</div>



<p>Another excuse we often hear is “we don’t need it” or “we’ll deal with it when we get there.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you already know, this isn’t a very sound plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most common cyber attacks is in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">malware</a>&nbsp;. All it takes is one person to open a link or download a file —whether intentional or accidental— for a cyber criminal to gain access to your network and devices. When that happens, all your files will be inaccessible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you think you can do business if you lose access to all your data?</p>



<p>Interested now? Below are 10 tips you can follow to protect your your business.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>10 Simple Ways to Protect Your Business Online</h2>



<h3 id="mfa">1. Enable multi-factor authentication</h3>



<p>Usernames and passwords are a key target for hackers, and with good reason — your identity and data are your most valuable asset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last January 2019, the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">biggest data breach</a>&nbsp;(yet) exposed over 1.2 billion email addresses. A few months after, one of the most well-known&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">online graphics software</a>&nbsp;also had a breach that impacted 137 million subscribers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">Strong and secure passwords</a>&nbsp;go a long way, but passwords alone are not the most secure authentication mechanism. Watch this video of a&nbsp;<strong>lesser-known</strong>hacking that could wind up getting unnoticed by you or anyone in your organization.&nbsp;</p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/kxlgfmbu2t.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_kxlgfmbu2t popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true videoFoam=true" style="display:inline-block;height:100%;position:relative;width:100%">&nbsp;</span></div></div>



<p>Here are some quick facts:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>90% of data stolen by phishing are user credentials.&nbsp;</li><li>80-90% of passwords can be hacked in under 24 hours.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) gives you an additional layer of security. If you have MFA enabled in your accounts, you will be required to use two or more independent credentials to prove your identity. Once you finish those&nbsp;<em>extra&nbsp;</em>steps, only then will you be able to access your account.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="password">2. Strengthen your passwords</h3>



<p>Passwords are ubiquitous in our daily lives. From email to social media to bank accounts — we all have passwords.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They are the first line of defense in protecting your identity and data. Sadly, far too often, they are also the only line of defense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at these statistics:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>59% know a secure password is important, yet only 41% choose a password that is easy to remember.&nbsp;</li><li>91% understand the risk of reusing passwords, but 55% do it anyway.</li></ul>



<p>If your device or service doesn’t support MFA, the next best option is making your password harder to crack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/hp_cyber-security-field-manual_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">cyber security manual</a>&nbsp;provides more information like using a mnemonic over numeric ones. To learn more, you can download the PDF by clicking on the link above.</p>



<p>One other way you can create a strong password that is virtually impossible for hackers to crack is to use a password manager.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, it’s another service that forces you to create another account and remember another password. But, what if that’s the only password you need to remember for the rest of your life? Head on over here to&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">watch this step-by-step tutorial</a>&nbsp;of how to use one of the most popular password managers out there.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="antimalware">3. Use anti malware software</h3>



<p>Without an anti-malware or antivirus software, your PC could be infected by malware within minutes of connecting to the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have one, get one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a lot of anti malware software out there to choose from. There are free and paid ones. Of course, the free ones will have limited capabilities, but it’s still better than having zero protection for your devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re running Windows 10, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/hp_cyber-security-field-manual_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">download this manual</a>&nbsp;for instructions on how to make sure it is running and how to keep it running — as it is common for malware to first target security programs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="update">4. Keep your software up to date</h3>



<p>More and more malware is created every day. They are getting more sophisticated and intelligent that they can bypass anti-malware software from time to time.</p>



<p>But the fact remains that&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-2008-end-of-support/">the older your software, the less secure it is</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why the most common ways for manufacturers and brands to combat vulnerabilities is by releasing updates or patches. This applies to both operating systems (OS) like Windows or Mac, and all the applications running on your computer like internet browsers, office applications, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important group of devices to highlight are the Internet of Things (IoT) devices you have at home. These are your routers, smart speakers, CCTV cameras, light bulbs, and media centers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="browser">5. Secure your browser</h3>



<p>The #1 way we connect to the internet is through an internet browser. We use it for checking email, browsing social media, and searching the web for answers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why it’s also the #1 target for hackers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Attacks via browsers typically come by way of an accidental or intentional click on a link that launches malware.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are four quick tips to ensure you reduce your chances of a malware attack:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><strong>Use a secure browser</strong> — A quick Google search of the topic reveals big names such as Firefox and Chrome as the most secured browser. </li><li><strong>Heed warnings</strong> — If the browser detects you are visiting a (potentially) malicious site, it often shows you a warning page first. </li><li><strong>Keep it current</strong> — As previously mentioned, updates provide fixes to bugs and vulnerabilities. Enable automatic browser updates so you don’t have to worry about this again. </li><li><strong>Restrict content and plugins</strong> — Many browsers allow for plugins or extensions. Consider reviewing them and limiting your usage to the ones that you trust. </li></ol>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/rc3ohjgjti.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_rc3ohjgjti videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/rc3ohjgjti/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="swatch" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" title="10 Steps Every Business Should Take to Protect Against Cyber Attacks 2"></div></div></div></div>



<h3 id="router">6. Router security and private network</h3>



<p>Anyone who connects to the interned does so through a router. This hardware device, either wired or wireless, allows communication between the internet and your local network (i.e. your computer and possibly other connected devices).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a 2018 report, routers were cited as the most frequently exploited type of device in IoT attacks. Hackers can use malware in design flaws to hide their identity, steal bandwidth, turn your devices into botnet zombies —or worse. They can also take advantage of any unsecured devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like with your browsers, here are 4 tips you can do to secure your network at home or work:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Secure your network</strong>&nbsp;using a non-default administrator password. Note that this is different from your Wi-Fi password. This is the access to the administrator settings of your router.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Configure the highest encryption</strong>&nbsp;supported by your router. Going from the strongest to the weakest, these are as follows:&nbsp;<ol><li>WPA3</li><li>WPA2</li><li>WPA</li><li>WEP</li></ol></li><li><strong>Keep your firmware up to date</strong>. According to one study,&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">83% of routers have vulnerabilities</a>. A router with the latest updates is much less likely to be infected by malware.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)</strong>&nbsp;to add another layer of protection to your identity and information.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h3 id="wifi">7. Protect yourself on public Wi-Fi</h3>



<p>Public Wi-Fi is everywhere — cafes, airports, shopping malls, and outdoor parks. They’re incredibly convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And dangerous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of the public nature of these connections, there’s a real chance someone could take advantage of unsecured traffic. Watch this video to understand one of the real threats from an unprotected Wi-Fi network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to reduce your risks on public Wi-Fi is to limit your activity. Don’t work on any “sensitive” documents and send them over the network. If you must, make sure you stick to encrypted sites and use a VPN.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="visual">8. Stop visual hackers</h3>



<p>As the modern workplace continues to move outside traditional offices to remote and public spaces, the possibility of being “visually hacked” is more real than ever. It’s simple, effective, and often gets unnoticed until it is too late.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best way to protect yourself is to be aware of your environment. Always assume that someone could look over your shoulder and see what’s on your screen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also consider using privacy filters on your devices, but that would only work if they viewing at a certain angle. According to a research published by the Ponemon Institute:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>91% visual hacking attempts were successful</li><li>68% of visual hacking attempts went unnoticed by the victim</li><li>52% of sensitive information was captured directly from device screens</li></ul>



<h3 id="encrypt">9. Encrypt your data</h3>



<p>Do you know where your files and data are stored in your computer or laptop?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hard drive, or in more modern devices, the solid state drive (SSD).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But did you know that your computer’s hard drive is only held in place by a few screws? Once removed, your hard drive can be access on another device. And if you haven’t enabled encryption on your hard drive, anybody can easily access your data and other sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you’re using a Mac or Windows, make sure that it is encrypted. And take note,&nbsp;<strong>encryption of your hard drive is different from having a password on your device</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That password only opens your device by default. You still have to enable encryption yourself. For example, on a Mac, that would mean turning on the FileVault under the Security &amp; Privacy setting.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="436" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/filevault-mac-1024x436.png" alt="FileVault Encryption on Mac" class="wp-image-7856" title="10 Steps Every Business Should Take to Protect Against Cyber Attacks 3"></figure>



<p>For Windows 10, there is a feature called BitLocker that provides software encryption that can be unlocked with a hardware key.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="bios">10. Secure your PC below the OS</h3>



<p>The BIOS (basic input output software) is software that boots a computer and helps load the operating system. By infecting this core software, hackers can plant malware that remains live and undetected by antivirus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a hacker gains access to your BIOS, they essentially own every aspect of your PC. By keeping your software updated, any discovered vulnerability will have been fixed in the update. Another way to reduce your risk is to implement a BIOS password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can also limit unused features such as booting from external devices. Keeping this setting on can allow for malware to be loaded from external sources. If you really need to, that’s the only time you turn it on.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>Cyber security is a very important topic that business leaders like you should take seriously. The risks to your organisation is very real and very huge. More than 60% of businesses have shut down within 6 months after a successful cyber attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For specific steps on how you can protect your business from cyber attacks, download this free&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/hp_cyber-security-field-manual_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Cyber Security Field Manual</a>.</p>

<p>Apps abound everywhere. Because
of their popularity, we’ve become extremely reliant on them to get our
day-to-day work done. One such tool is Canva — a graphic-design tool website
that allows you to easily create stunning graphics by simple drag-and-drop.</p>



<p>But in May 2019, <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#Canva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canva suffered a data breach</a> that impacted 137 million subscribers. The exposed data included email addresses, usernames, names, cities of residence and passwords. </p>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h.jsonp" async=""></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async=""></script><div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_n9n0uton1h videoFoam=true" style="height:100%;position:relative;width:100%"><div class="wistia_swatch" style="height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;"><img src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/n9n0uton1h/swatch" style="filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;" alt="swatch" aria-hidden="true" onload="this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;" title="Canva Website Breach and PDL Data Breach 2019 6"></div></div></div></div>



<p>But, did you know that another
breach was found just last month? </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-enrichment-people-data-labs-and-another-622m-email-addresses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exposed data</a> from data enrichment company People Data
Labs (PDL) contained over 622 million email addresses. While this isn’t as big
as the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1 breach</a> earlier this year, this should concern
you more. </p>



<p>While the collection is
impressive for its sheer volume, the data doesn&#8217;t include sensitive information
like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. It does,
though, contain profiles of hundreds of millions of people that include home
and cell phone numbers, associated social media profiles like Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, and Github, work histories seemingly scraped from LinkedIn,
almost 50 million unique phone numbers, and 622 million unique email addresses.
&#8211; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/billion-records-exposed-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wired</a></p>



<p>As more and more breaches and cyber security incidents happen, the more we all have to learn how we can protect ourselves online. Below are three things you should do immediately after learning that your data as part of a breach. </p>



<h2>3 Things You Need to Do Immediately After a Data Breach</h2>



<h3>1. Change your passwords</h3>



<p>The moment you learn of a data
breach, especially if you are part of the breach, it’s the perfect time to
change your password. </p>



<p>To those asking, a data breach
or leak doesn’t necessarily mean your account was accessed. It’s possible, yes.
But unless you can speak with the hacker, you can’t be 100% sure. </p>



<p>This leaves you with the next
best course of action — change your password. </p>



<p>To ensure you won’t risk
getting hacked again, we’ve created a <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-series-passwords/">4-day email course on creating and using stronger passwords</a>.
</p>



<h3>2. Don’t reuse passwords</h3>



<p>91% understand the risk of reusing
passwords, but 55% do it anyway. </p>



<p>Please, if you want to remain
safe online, stop reusing passwords. </p>



<p>Why? </p>



<p>Because it’s very difficult to
remember unique passwords for all our accounts. </p>



<p>Quick question: when was the
last time you counted how many accounts and profiles you have? </p>



<p>Me? I have <strong>348 accounts</strong>
accounted for. Possibly even more. </p>



<p>Now, if you have over 300+
accounts, which you most likely do, can you remember strong, unique passwords
for every one of them? </p>



<p>Maybe, but it’s no easy feat. </p>



<p>The only way to <em>remember</em>
all your passwords without having to remember them is to use a password
manager. </p>



<p>That’s also the reason how I
knew I have 348 accounts. It’s the easiest way to manage all my accounts — from
email addresses, various social media accounts, WiFi passwords, tools like
Canva, and many more. </p>



<p>Learn how you can <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">use
password managers and stop reusing passwords</a> by watching this free
video.</p>



<h3>3. Understand the repercussions</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.dataviper.io/blog/2019/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinny Troia</a>, a dark web researcher, said &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen all these social media profiles collected and merged with user profile information into a single database on this scale. From the perspective of an attacker, if the goal is to impersonate people or hijack their accounts, you have names, phone numbers, and associated account URLs. That&#8217;s a lot of information in one place to get you started.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. </p>



<p>What information have you posed
on your social media accounts? </p>



<ul><li>Birthdays</li><li>Pets</li><li>Family
members and who’s related to whom</li></ul>



<p><strong>Aren’t these the same
information we use as passwords or security questions? </strong></p>



<p>If all that information is in
one place, it wouldn’t be difficult for someone to reset your passwords and
gain access to your accounts. </p>



<p>That is unless you enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA). </p>



<p>Without MFA, anyone with these data can try resetting the passwords to your accounts easily. Watch this video to learn the importance of MFA. </p>

<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> is a topic you should take seriously,
especially when it comes to your business. The risks and too great for you to
ignore. </p>



<p>In today’s increasingly
connected world, it’s almost impossible to not use apps and other online

<p>Let’s face it. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> isn’t the sexiest topic out there. But, as we rely on the internet more each day — our phones, computers, and other appliances at home and work — you cannot take online security for granted. </p>



<p>That’s why we curated the best videos we can find on cyber security which are at the same time, not boring. </p>



<h2>4 Cyber Security Videos That Are Not Boring</h2>



<h3>1. How cyber security would look like in real life</h3>



<p>When people think cyber security, they often don’t associate it being in the “real world.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s only on the internet, right? It can’t affect me.</p></blockquote>



<p>That’s why it is often difficult to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">understand what these terms are and what they mean</a>. </p>



<p>Watch this video to find out how cyber security would look like in real life…</p>

<h3>2. Are your passwords secure? </h3>



<p>“What’s the password to your email”</p>



<p>“Not even a clue? Is it a combination of your birthday? Does it have your pet’s name on it? Great. </p>



<p>“When’s your birthday? What’s the name of your pet? </p>



<p>“Thanks. So, I now have your email password…</p>



<p>Watch this funny video to see how people willingly give out their passwords to strangers on the street. </p>

<h3>3. Theft in the 21th century</h3>



<p>You’ve bought a brand new and sophisticated car. You’ve installed CCTV cameras and home security software. </p>



<p>You’re safe from robbers, right? </p>

<h3>4. Cyber security starts at the top</h3>



<p>Ready to take cyber security seriously? </p>



<p>As with every implementation, cyber security has to start at the top! </p>



<p><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6523545851179134976?compact=1" allowfullscreen="" width="504" height="284" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Cyber security is real. Cyber criminals are real. And it’s no longer confined to the “internet.” <br>As technology improves and permeates our everyday lives, it’s best to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">stop treating cyber risk as a separate type of risk</a>. </p>
