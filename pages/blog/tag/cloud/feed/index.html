<p>After <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/build-strong-foundation/">building a strong foundation</a> and addressing your business’ vision, culture, and leadership, it’s time to move the different aspects of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">digital transformation</a>. </p>



<p><em>Remember that the road to digital transformation is different for everybody. </em></p>



<ul><li>Does your company limit the amount of email storage you can have at any time? </li><li>Do you have to keep deleting your messages because your inbox is full and can’t receive new messages? </li><li>Or have you experienced not being able to access your email for a couple of days because your IT department is doing some server maintenance? </li></ul>



<p>What if you didn’t have to deal with this problem anymore? What if you have virtually unlimited storage? What if you can access your emails 24/7, anywhere you are in the world? </p>

<h3 class="rank-math-question ">Why should you use cloud-based email?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer "><p>Using cloud-based email allows you more flexibility in storage, less maintenance, scalability, and many more. Find out the 7 reasons why you should migrate your email to the cloud. </p>
</div>

<h2>7 Reasons to Migrate Your Email to the Cloud</h2>



<p>Migrating email from a self-hosted to cloud-hosted might seem like a very simple task. But if you look at it more closely, there are a few variables you need to consider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to create a seamless migration from your local mail server to the cloud (like Microsoft or Google), all user accounts and data must remain in-tact. This includes every single mail folder and every message. Users should not be able to detect that anything has changed.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>1. More storage</h3>



<p>Migrating to a cloud-based email allows you to virtually have unlimited storage. On-premise email servers are often limited by their storage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, your IT administrator might only allow you to keep 512 MB worth of email at any point in time. When your usage exceeds that, you won’t be able to receive new messages. You will then have to delete some (or all) your email before you receive new messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine the consequences of this to your business if you forget to manage your email storage. What do you think would happen if you miss emails like these:</p>



<ul><li>email from a dissatisfied customer who happens to also be one of your key accounts</li><li>email from a supplier/vendor saying that they won’t be able to deliver your order on time — which would cause you to miss your own targets</li><li>email from your boss or colleague about a critical status update on a project you are working on</li></ul>



<p>When you migrate your email to the cloud, you won’t have to deal with these issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because all cloud email providers start you off with a huge amount of storage. For example, a personal Gmail account will give you 15 Gb of storage, while a business account starts with 30Gb. A Microsoft subscription will start you off with 1 Gb per user.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2. Faster disaster recovery</h3>



<p>Most businesses don’t often think of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protecting-critical-data-in-your-business/">disaster recovery</a> until it happens to them. By then, it would be too late. </p>



<p>Let’s say a fire started in your office caused by one of the other tenants in the building. What if this happened during the weekend?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have a disaster recovery program in place and your office got caught in the fire (or flood, or earthquake, or some other disaster), how long do you think you can resume business?&nbsp;</p>



<p>With cloud-based email, you won’t have to worry about this yourself. Your provider will take care of this for you. And more likely, they will already have a disaster recovery program in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, Microsoft and Google (two big names in cloud-hosted email) have millions of servers (housed inside data centres) across the world. So, if something happened to the data centre in North America or Asia, you would still be able to access your emails because they are backed up in another data centre in another continent. </p>



<h3>3. Less server maintenance&nbsp;</h3>



<p>One of the best practices of on-site servers is to conduct frequent preventive maintenance. This ensures that both the hardware and software running is at optimal conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/backups/">Backups</a> and other stuff are performed during this time as well. </p>



<p>While this practice is true for all servers, if you’re using a cloud-based email that means you don’t have to do this yourself. </p>



<p>You don’t have to allot resources — time and money — to do the maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oftentimes, when your IT administrator performs server maintenance, work stops for the entire business. That’s why maintenance work is done during weekends and/or nighttime or early morning. </p>



<p>But in today’s world where our customers expect us to be there for them 24/7, we can’t afford to be “offline” for a couple of days.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>4. Enable remote work</h3>



<p>As you may have already noticed, the work you do today can be done outside the office. As technology improves, you can pretty much do a lot of things with a laptop or your phone and an internet connection. That means you don’t need to be in the office in order to work.</p>



<p>This is the trend globally — <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/inside-the-modern-workplace-is-your-organisation-ready/">remote work or telecommuting</a>. That’s why you see people working in cafes, at home, or even in transit. </p>



<p>With an on-premise email server, you won’t have this luxury. Sometimes, you can only access your email if you’re connected to the company network. That means you have to be in your office premises. </p>



<p>Or in other cases, you will be limited by your access. </p>



<p>Oftentimes, you can only access your email accounts from a work-issued device. So, if you happen to forget that at home or left it at the office, you can’t check your email using your phone or personal laptop. </p>



<h3>5. Cost savings</h3>



<p>The pricing of cloud-based email is often on a per-user basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means is you don’t have to pay upfront a huge amount as compared to when you use an on-premise server. Depending on the one you buy, this could easily be a few thousand dollars. This will probably last you for 2-3 years before it starts showing signs of aging. By then, you will have to decide whether to upgrade or buy a new one (which would then cost you another thousand dollars). Of course, you’d also have to do regular maintenance on it to make it last longer which also costs money. </p>

<p>For cloud-based email, you will only be paying ~$5 per person. Plus, most of these provides offer a lot more than just email. For example, a Microsoft Office 365 account will also give you access to the office suites (Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and 1 Tb of storage. Now that’s value for money.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>6. Flexible Scalability</h3>



<p>A cloud-based email also gives you flexibility, not just in terms of costs, but also your options as a business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you hire additional people during the holidays and cut back after it. This can easily be done with cloud-based email as you can add accounts easily, then once they leave, you can assign and transfer all their emails and files to another person.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>7. Improved Security</h3>



<p>You might think of having on-premise servers as being more secured than being hosted on the cloud. Unless you can invest in your own 24/7 security and backup recovery system (as discussed earlier), you won’t be able to match the level of security of the big cloud providers like Google and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>Migrating your emails to the cloud gives you a lot of flexibility in your business. It allows you to focus on the more important things, rather than spending it on administrative tasks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some believe that by 2028,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/73-of-all-teams-will-have-remote-workers-in-the-next-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">73% of all teams will have remote workers</a>. If you aren’t ready or not preparing for it, it will be harder for you to attract and retain talent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Migrating to the cloud isn’t only for big companies. It’s not only for those in the tech industry, too. The cloud is <strong>for everyone</strong> who wants to stay relevant amidst the changing market conditions today and tomorrow. </p>



<p>Are you ready to take advantage of cloud-based email?</p>

But, after migrating to the cloud, their productivity went up, become more mobile, and saved over $40,000 in IT costs. </p>



<p>Watch the interview with Grace Ikiua, CEO of Good Seed Trust, to learn how we migrated the entire business to the cloud.</p>

<h2>Good Seed Trust Background</h2>



<p>Grace starts off the interview by sharing more about the history of Good Seed Trust. </p>



<p>“​I was on the Management Board of an early childhood centre that my friend had started in that 1980s and in 2006 the church offered it to us. So we formed Good Seed Trust.”</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re a non for profit, and the purpose of it is we want to build family hubs that strengthen families so that they can strengthen their community. So we&#8217;ve got 45 staff and we actually have five different sites because we don&#8217;t just do early childhood.”</p>



<p>“We have a wraparound service. We offer different programs that the parents have sort of asked for. We provide transport with family engagement workers. So we have one-on-one family coaching available.”</p>

<h2>The State of SMBs in New Zealand</h2>



<p>Dave Wilson, General Manager of iT360, shares his assessment of Good Seed Trust’ business environment. </p>



<p>“​The technology we found here at Good Seed Trust wasn&#8217;t unlike too many other businesses really. Windows computers that are just pieced together, trying to hang on.” </p>



<p>Legacy systems like on-premise servers are prevalent in New Zealand businesses. And while there’s nothing wrong with them, oftentimes, business owners think that it’s still the most effective way to run their business. </p>



<p>But, as most people who experienced working with on-premise servers, the moment these fill up with documents or as time goes by, they become inefficient. They’re not as fast as they used to. </p>



<p>Stefan Venter, iT360’s Business Development Manager said, “There&#8217;s older documents lying here. Someone saved it elsewhere and it all just turned into custard.” </p>



<p>“With the server, if you were at one of our remote sites, like in Otahu, it took 10 minutes to upload a photo. Often it crashed. It just wasn&#8217;t working,” Grace recalls. </p>



<p>As additional background, one of the tasks of the staff is to create storybooks. These are given periodically to the parents to keep them posted on the progress of their children. </p>



<p>This involves uploading/downloading photos for all the children periodically. If it takes you over 10 minutes just to <em>process</em> a single photo, imagine how much time it would take to do that for 20 kids? </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It means that for people like myself, we can work anywhere…I’m loving it.</p><cite>Grace Ikiua, CEO</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Moving to the Cloud 100%</h2>



<p>“This is presented a wonderful opportunity for us to say, look, ‘why don&#8217;t we completely transform the IT here and move this to the cloud,’” Dave said. </p>



<p>“Microsoft cloud platform gives so many benefits to small businesses like Good Seed. Its security, its platform; it&#8217;s a tight ecosystem. It&#8217;s like no other.“</p>



<p>Introducing change to any organization will be met by friction. That’s why when we work on any project, we do it in phases. </p>



<p>“So we recommended, firstly, Azure to replace the server. Sharepoint to replace the documents. Exchange online for the email. And the last thing was Teams for the team collaboration.”</p>



<p>This was what we presented to Grace. We shared the benefits, explained the tools, what’s involved, and how Good Seed Trust can benefit from migrating to the cloud. </p>



<p>As a non-technical decision maker, Grace needed to understand how the <em>new technology</em> will affect them, “and so I knew when iT360 started talking about what we could do, I knew what was possible.” </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img width="2560" height="1440" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/39981514_288893961900219_7486302703312699392_n.jpg" alt="39981514 288893961900219 7486302703312699392 n" class="wp-image-5622" title="How We Enabled the Good Seed Trust to Improve Staff Performance and Protect the Business 2"></figure></div>



<h2>Good Seed Trust Today After a Year of Migration</h2>



<p>“The cloud migration totally transformed the way that the business works, the way that people collaborate,” Dave said. </p>



<p>Stefan also shared how the staff are using the technology. </p>



<p>“Sharepoint also made document management, very easy versioning. Everyone knew exactly where the documentation was. If it needed updating, they know exactly where to go. There was no duplicates, none of that.”</p>



<p>One of the biggest benefit that the cloud offers is it gives the organization mobility. As you know, there’s a rise in telecommuting and the mobile workforce. The cloud is an integral part of capability. </p>



<p>“​It means that for people like myself, we can work anywhere…I’m loving it” </p>



<p>Grace also shares an example of a routine task they do. What used to take them over a week, now just take them less than two days to complete. Everything was just much streamlined and easier for everybody. </p>



<p>“We have an accounts person offsite, and she sees us our monthly reconciliation and we used to have like six versions of that floating around and emailing and coming back and now we have the document loaded in sharepoint. Everyone just goes into the one document, adds their bit, and we send that to her. That takes two days where that would usually take over a week.”</p>



<h2>Managing Change</h2>



<p>Technology is only useful if people use it. You may have the best equipment out there, but if you and your staff isn’t using it, it would just be an expensive purchase. </p>



<p>Dave shares how we manage change and make sure the staff will really adapt the technology. ​“Yeah, so managing change within a business is always difficult. To do that, we held workshops with the staff and we got people to really accept the tools, before we made the decision to move to the platform.”</p>



<p>“​They came in and did a meeting with our leaders and the biggest thing is just getting people who are not very confident with IT and moving them to a place with they&#8217;re confident,” says Grace. </p>



<p>Stefan shared something really important when it comes to adopting new technologies, “For us to really get people invested in a new solution is really to explain to them how it&#8217;s going to solve a problem.” </p>



<p> In business, one of the most common problems is that of communication especially for off-site staff — whether they’re located in another office or traveling — collaborating with them is a challenge. And that’s where the right technology will help ease this burden. </p>



<p>“Microsoft teams was really just collaboration, so how are we gonna fix the traveling? How are we going to fix not being able to get in touch with people?” </p>



<p>When asked about her assessment of iT360’s approach to managing change and introducing the new technologies, Grace says “​I think as they start to see the usefulness of it, they just buy into it more.”</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img width="2560" height="1707" src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_2091.jpg" alt="IMG 2091" class="wp-image-5621" title="How We Enabled the Good Seed Trust to Improve Staff Performance and Protect the Business 3"></figure></div>



<h2>Front and Centre, Not Behind the Scenes</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, technology is only useful if it’s implemented and used by people. That’s why we conduct workshops and interview key stakeholders prior to implementing something new. Dave shares his thoughts on this. </p>



<p>“There&#8217;s this kind of stigma on IT guys being in the back office, but we choose to be front right and centre, because ultimately technology these days needs to be adopted by people and the way you do that is by having that very personal relationship.” </p>



<h2>Relationships </h2>



<p>“And I think the biggest thing for me is they treat you like part of the family, not just like as a customer. And I trust them implicitly that they&#8217;re going to do the best for us.”</p>



<p>“They understand our cost restraints, and they always would look at it a best cost value for us, not for them.”</p>



<h2>Onwards and Upwards: What Good Seed Trust Is Planning  Next</h2>



<p>​“Well what we&#8217;re looking at doing is using Teams next. It&#8217;s all been loaded on the computers and we&#8217;ll start training people and just make more time efficient, and we want to be up in the 21st century and using things to make us more efficient and alongside that we&#8217;re looking at going paperless,” Grace shares. </p>



<p>When asked about the entire project, Dave says “it’s absolutely thrilling to see when customers adopt the technology that we&#8217;re so passionate about. And it&#8217;s been the best thing to see Good Seed Trust change and transform and ultimately we know are a small part to play in the improvement of learning outcomes for the children here.” </p>
