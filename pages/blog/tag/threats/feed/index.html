<p>Virus threats and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> are almost a daily occurrence in the life of those in IT. But for those who feel pretty far removed from such a reality, it can be a very scary situation when it does happen to you and your business.</p>



<p>It can, and does happen, and with online threats a very real issue it is imperative that your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">business’s data is&nbsp;secure and always backed-up correctly</a>.</p>



<p>Sure, some threats are merely irritating, but some cause real damage&nbsp;to an organisation; from losing data to requiring an expensive repair, as well as <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">hit to the businesses reputation</a> (particularly if private details are compromised).</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-insurance/">What is cyber security insurance and should you get it?</a></p>



<p>So what do you need to know about IT virus and cyber security threats?&nbsp;Here are the most common ones out there today.</p>



<h2>6 Most Common Virus Threats to Your Business</h2>



<h3>1. Crypto-Ransomware</h3>



<p>Perhaps one of most confronting cyber threats right now is crypto-ransomware (also called cryptolocker, cryptowall, and CTB-locker). A form of malware, files on a PC or network storage are encrypted with code so they are unaccessible to the user, who then has to pay money for them to be ‘unlocked’.</p>



<h3>2. Shadow IT</h3>



<p>Shadow IT is the use of unauthorised software and applications by employees, and it is a problem. Aside from overloading network resources and impacting on data compliance, there is also the real threat of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">security breaches</a> from unapproved and un-monitored apps.</p>



<p><strong>This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business? Download:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/it-guide-sme-business/"><strong>An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity</strong></a></p>



<h3>3. Trojan horse</h3>



<p>A Trojan horse is a program that appears to be legitimate but actually contains another program or block of undesired malicious, destructive code, disguised and hidden in a block of desirable code. Trojans can be used to infect a computer with a virus.</p>



<p>A back-door Trojan is a program that allows a remote user or hacker to bypass the normal access controls of a computer and gain unauthorised control over it. Typically a virus is used to place the back-door Trojan onto a computer, and once the computer is online, the person who sent the Trojan can run programs on the infected computer, access personal files, and modify and upload files.</p>



<h3>4. Worms</h3>



<p>Viruses and worms spread across computers and networks by making copies of themselves, usually without the knowledge of the computer user.</p>



<h3>5. Botnets</h3>



<p>A botnet is a group of infected, remotely-controlled computers.</p>



<p>The hacker sends out a virus, Trojan or worm to&nbsp;ordinary computers. The virus, Trojan or worm gains access to the computer, usually through some malicious application that they are carrying. This in turn allows the hacker to gain full control of the now-infected computers. These computers can then be used to launch denial-of service attacks, distribute spam emails and commit click fraud, identity theft and thefts of log-in details and credit card numbers.</p>



<p>Botnets are very difficult to prevent by the use of software tools alone, it is important that users follow best practice guidance with regards to emails and website usage. See our guide on how to introduce an internet and email policy. It is important that you ensure that all software and anti-virus tools are up-to-date, to prevent malicious code from exploiting security holes in software and making your system vulnerable.</p>



<h3>6. Spyware</h3>



<p>Spyware is installed on a users computer or network, without their knowledge, and collects private information like passwords, keystrokes, internet interaction and other valuable data. Often hidden in freeware or shareware that&nbsp;is downloaded from the internet, some are actually for very legitimate purposes, but most of the time it is related to&nbsp;malicious actions.</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Cyber security</a> is just as important as the physical locks and alarms around your home – if not more so. A hacker can do untold damage to your business and brand, resulting in far more stress than a stolen TV or missing jewellery. So how can you protect yourself against online threats?</p>



<h2>How to Avoid Cyber Security Threats</h2>



<h3>Stay up-to-date with the latest news and knowledge</h3>



<p>Many savvy business owners inform themselves about&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;by attending courses (or sending employees on their behalf) and reading the latest cyber security news. While these courses are often extremely helpful and informative, the problem is that the <strong>knowledge gained only lasts so long</strong>.</p>



<p>Just as technology itself evolves every week, cyber security does too. This means that once the course finishes, you will be missing out on the latest news and information from the industry. Staying informed about threats is like keeping up with the latest viral social media trends – you have to be watching it every single day (or at the very least, every week).</p>



<h3>How to keep up with the latest cyber security threats</h3>



<p>There are a few great ways to keep yourself informed about the latest updates. For example, you can sign up to thought leaders in the field of cyber security.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dark Reading</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securityweek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security Week</a>&nbsp;are both good online sources of regular news and commentary. Many of these sources even offer regular email updates so you can access the most important news straight from your inbox.</p>



<p>Another good option is to check to see if your IT security company offers regular newsletters, reports, or other resources. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-resource-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WatchGuard resource centre</a>&nbsp;is a perfect example of where you can find webinars, whitepapers, and other up-to-date pieces of information that will help keep you and your team on top of security. These options are great for the latest news, but they can also help fill any gaps in your knowledge that you may not have already covered, or that you may have forgotten.</p>



<p>Or, if you just want to receive these topics directly, you can enroll in our cyber security email series. The first topic we covered is on passwords. Just enter your email in the form below and you&#8217;ll start receiving the first email right away!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>The importance of having a ‘plan B’</h3>



<p>While keeping yourself, or your IT staff, as informed as possible about cyber security, threats, trends, and the latest news, it’s vital to have a ‘plan B’. After all, it’s extremely tough to stay on top of everything when you have countless other areas to keep on top of, such as marketing and customer service.</p>



<p>That plan B should be a cyber security company in which you have total confidence when it comes to keeping you informed, and being proactive about existing and new cyber security threats or concerns. This way, should your sales targets, busy periods and personal hurdles come in between you and staying on top of IT issues, you know your business’ assets and information are still as safe as houses (or indeed, safer).</p>



<p><strong>Business leaders need to realise that cyber security is a big deal. It affects reputation, internal communication and even company culture. Keen to understand more about Online Security Protection for New Zealand businesses? <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/go/online-security-for-nz-businesses/ebook/">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE!</a></strong></p>

<p>A flexible company culture can do wonders for productivity, creativity and team morale. But without proper precautions in place, it could also pose a threat to cyber security.</p>



<p>Despite huge advancements in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> technology,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/training-what-training-workers-lack-of-cybersecurity-awareness-is-putting-the-business-at-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">human error is still a leading cause of serious security breaches</a>.</p>



<p>Remote working, document sharing, the use of personal devices at work – these are all hallmarks of a flexible company culture, designed to foster collaboration and innovation in the workplace.</p>



<h3>Flexibility vs Vulnerability</h3>



<p>However, there’s a fine line between flexibility and vulnerability. It’s important to ensure that your company culture doesn’t expose any weaknesses in your cyber security strategy. The sharing of company data across multiple devices could put your intellectual property at risk.</p>



<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axelos.com/Corporate/media/Files/cyber-awareness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research by AXELOS</a>, an education management organisation committed to identifying global best practice in IT service management and cyber resilience, “organisations need to recognise the importance of the ‘human factor’ in protecting their most precious information assets and systems”.</p>



<p>The research paper, titled ‘Are your people playing an effective role in your cyber resilience?’, argues that employees are both an organisation’s “most effective security control” and “potentially, their greatest vulnerability to attack”.</p>



<p>So how can you foster a flexible company culture based on open collaboration, while also protecting sensitive information?</p>



<p>By creating a culture of awareness, education, trust, and accountability. Many people are simply unaware that their actions could be putting security at risk. It’s therefore up to you to educate them about their cyber security responsibilities within the workplace.</p>



<h3>Cultural Shifts Need to Happen</h3>



<p>A good place to start is by creating a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-create-an-it-policy/">cyber security information policy</a> and include it in employee contracts and handbooks. This policy should clearly state your organisation’s rules surrounding cyber security, and be regularly updated to accommodate industry advancements.</p>



<p>However, a written policy will not be enough to change your company culture. To create a cultural shift, you will need to <strong>talk to employees about cyber security on a regular basis</strong>, in both one-on-one situations and wider team meetings, as well as digitally (for example, via email or staff intranet). Cyber security is not a ‘set and forget’ strategy; it must continually be revisited and discussed so that it says at the forefront of everyone’s mind.</p>



<p>AXELOS advises that organisations take this one step further, and roll out customised employee training programmes, so that no one is learning about rules that don’t relate to their position, and vice versa.</p>



<p>“Your training and awareness learning might be telling staff to do things that are not relevant and not part of their working life. The learning needs to be directly related to what they do.”</p>



<p>It’s also essential to <strong>foster a culture of trust, as opposed to surveillance</strong>. If employees feel they are operating in a ‘Big Brother’ environment, this may negatively impact other facets of your company culture, such as collaboration and innovation. The best way to foster trust is to encourage regular, open conversations and feedback. Cyber security communication should always be a two-way street.</p>



<p>Once everyone in your organisation understands the importance of cyber security, it will be much easier for you to implement security techniques and technology, such as firewalls and mobile device management (MDM). People are far more likely to follow rules if they understand the reasoning behind them; aim for awareness first, implementation second</p>
