<p><a href="https://www.goodseedtrust.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good Seed Trust</a>, a non-profit dedicated to helping build strong families, was facing a lot of inefficiencies in their daily operations. The main reason for this is they were using old servers that have seen their day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ageing server meant downloading photos for storybooks was time-consuming, taking up to 10 minutes for staff at outlying offices to download a single photo.</p>



<p><strong>Duplicate files</strong> were also causing an issue, with up to five copies of the same document spread across the network.</p>



<p>These technological inefficiencies add more work for the staff — causing frustrations. </p>



<p>The solution is to either get new servers or move to the cloud. </p>



<p>Good Seed Trust CEO, Grace Ikiua, said, “we want everything saved in one safe place – not on the PCs. So it makes sense to go to the cloud. We’re trying to change behaviour.&#8221; </p>



<p>Buying new servers is costly. It&#8217;s also short-sighted. </p>



<p>&#8220;It’s important to be forward-thinking and to take us into the 21st century. Good systems, less paper, less files and folders is part of that,” says Grace. </p>



<p>In a couple of years, these <em>new</em> servers would have to be replaced again. Moving to the cloud was the logical choice. </p>
