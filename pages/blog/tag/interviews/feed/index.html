<p>Wondering how other organisations use <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a>? Here are four interviews from different industry experts sharing how they use MS Teams and how it&#8217;s transforming the way they do business. </p>



<p>In this article, you&#8217;ll find 4 videos that cover specific topics. You can either watch the video, or read the write-up, or both. Enjoy! </p>



<h2>Get to Know the People in the Videos</h2>



<ul><li>Anthony McMahon, Chief Technologist, the <a href="https://vcto.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IT Psychiatrist</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janine-brittain-3ab119b3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Janine Brittain</a>, Microsoft Modern Workplace BDM, <a href="https://online.exeed.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exeed</a></li><li>Randy Chapman, Head of Consulting, <a href="https://www.enablit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enablit</a> and Microsoft AVP</li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-kelley-msft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Kelley</a>, Teams Customer Success Black Belt, Microsoft</li></ul>



<h2>Part 1: Focus on Solving Problems</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/1uychuo5z2.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_1uychuo5z2 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>One of the best ways to implement Microsoft Teams is to focus on a specific problem that it solves. You don&#8217;t need to dive into each individual feature. </p>



<p>Just answer the question &#8220;How is MS Teams going to help my business with ______?&#8221; Focus on problem instead. </p>



<ul><li><strong>You want to host a video call with several clients</strong>. Here&#8217;s how you do it. </li><li><strong>What about accessibility</strong>? Can I use it on any device? What if I switch from my work desktop computer to my mobile phone, to my home laptop? Yup, MS Teams got you covered. </li><li><strong>What about an unstable internet connection</strong>? MS Teams doesn&#8217;t need a perfect internet connection to run. </li></ul>



<h2>Part 2: Collaboration Made Easy</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/i56okw1amc.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_i56okw1amc popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>Microsoft calls Teams the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/work-better-implementing-hub-for-teamwork/">hub for teamwork</a>. If you aren&#8217;t using it for collaboration, you&#8217;re not using it right. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re tired of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/teams-vs-email-which-communication-medium-can-adapt-to-your-business-needs/">too many emails</a> and constant <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">storage and file issues</a>, then you will benefit greatly from using MS Teams. </p>



<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-buttons aligncenter">
<div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-color has-very-light-gray-color has-background has-vivid-red-background-color" style="border-radius:3px" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Access the Teams in 10 Days Videos</a></div>
</div>



<h2>Part 3: More Than Just Chat</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ipmkfxiqp8.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ipmkfxiqp8 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>How are you using MS Teams? Do you use it for chat and video calls? Good. That&#8217;s the most basic functionality. </p>



<p>Did you know you can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-ms-teams-for-internal-communication-5-different-options/">leave audio or voice notes</a> too? This is especially helpful if you&#8217;re on-the-go and want to send a message to someone quickly. </p>



<p>Have you tried recording your meeting? This is a great option for both internal and external uses. Internally, someone might not be able to make it to the meeting because of an emergency. With a single click of a button, you can record the entire meeting and it will be available to everyone in the channel. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s also a great way to record conversations with clients or other third party vendors. If you combine it with the whiteboard feature, or even just a regular meeting, this will be a very nice value-add. </p>



<p>What about trying to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/microsoft-teams-integration-with-other-apps/">work on the same files together</a>? You know, those monthly reports you send out. Or that spreadsheet everyone needs to add their inputs to. Instead of sending out the files from one person to another, causing multiple file versions, you can work on the files together inside Microsoft Teams. </p>



<h2>Part 4: Rolling Out MS Teams</h2>



<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/wm3ik5n445.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script><span class="wistia_embed wistia_async_wm3ik5n445 popover=true popoverAnimateThumbnail=true" style="display:inline-block;height:338px;position:relative;width:600px">&nbsp;</span>



<p>What&#8217;s the easiest way to roll out Microsoft Teams in your organisation? Show, don&#8217;t tell. </p>



<p>Demonstrate how easy it is to use different use cases. For example, one of the concerns of many during a virtual call is of privacy. MS Teams has a built-in function that, with a click of a button, blurs your entire background. This is perfect for work-from-home situations where you don&#8217;t want other meeting attendees to see what&#8217;s behind you. </p>



<p>One of the upsides of in-person meetings is the ability to illustrate what you&#8217;re trying to explainâ€”whether that&#8217;s a diagram, a flowchart, or simply mapping out a concept. With MS Teams, there&#8217;s a feature called <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-whiteboard-in-microsoft-teams-7a6e7218-e9dc-4ccc-89aa-b1a0bb9c31ee?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whiteboard</a> where you can do that. Now, there&#8217;s a lower barrier to conducting meetings since you do not have to always prepare slides.  </p>
