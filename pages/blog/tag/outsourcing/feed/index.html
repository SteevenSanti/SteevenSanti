										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With technology constantly evolving, most businesses do not have time to manage all of their IT systems, keep pace with software updates and fix technical problems as they arise. The solution? To outsource all of their IT needs to an external provider. This allows business owners to concentrate on what they do best, while trusting a team of IT experts to work their magic in the background.</p>



<p>That said, partnering with an IT provider does require a certain element of trust. As technology runs through nearly every area of your business, an IT company will likely be privy to the innermost workings of your organisation. This is why it’s essential to team up with a provider who you can trust to provide a professional and reliable service.</p>



<p>Below are five key things to look for in a great IT partner, to help you make this important decision.</p>



<h2>5 Key Things to Look for in a Great IT Partner</h2>



<h3>1. Expertise</h3>



<p>The level of expertise you require in an IT partner will depend on factors such as the size of your business, the current state of your IT systems and your plans for future expansion. Ideally, you want to work with a provider who can act as a ‘one-stop-shop’ for all of your IT needs. The last thing you want is to have to go between two or three different providers to ensure all of your IT requirements are met. Therefore, look for providers who have a proven track record and offer a wide range of services.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/does-your-it-company-speak-a-language-you-can-understand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Does your IT company speak a language you can understand?&nbsp;</a></p>



<h3>2. Proactivity</h3>



<p>The best IT partners are those who are proactive and solutions-focused. You’re engaging an IT partner because you need assistance and direction, so you want them to make suggestions for improvement and guide you on how to make the most of technology. This will give you peace of mind that you’re up-to-date with the latest tools and trends.</p>



<h3>3. Transparency</h3>



<p>In order for a partnership to be successful, there needs to be mutual trust and transparency. Look for IT companies that are willing to be open about their pricing, processes and abilities from the get-go. Where possible, put your expectations in writing, in the form of setting KPIs at the beginning of your agreement.</p>



<h3>4. Customer service and communication</h3>



<p>It’s important that you get along well with your IT partner as you’ll likely be speaking to them on a regular basis (we all know how often computers, printers and other devices tend to malfunction). Look for an IT partner who offers friendly, helpful customer service. You want to feel comfortable asking questions and reaching out for help.</p>



<h3>5. Good understanding of your business goals</h3>



<p>Every business is unique and has different IT needs. A good IT provider will be able to adjust their offerings to suit your company’s structure and goals. They will also be able to adapt as you grow and expand, or at least point you in the right direction if they cannot help you themselves. The best partner will make you feel like you’re their only client, even if they have several. It’s this personal, proactive support that makes outsourcing your IT needs well worth the cost.</p>

<p>There really is no doubt that IT in any business today is a critical component to get right in order to grow and have an edge over competitors.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s some of the news headlines over the past couple of years:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/76472117/technology-risks-a-growing-concern-for-directors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology risks a growing concern for directors</a></li><li><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2475885/elevating-the-conversation--how-to-better-communicate-with-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analytics now a boardroom conversation</a></li><li><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3461980/it-trends-set-to-shape-the-sector-in-2019.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business units flex budgetary muscles as tech purchasing patterns evolve</a></li><li><a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/77295880/more-than-half-of-nz-firms-unprepared-for-cybercrime-pwc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More than half of NZ firms unprepared for Cybercrime</a></li></ul>



<p>But some of us still aren’t doing it quite right, however. </p>



<p>That’s okay – acceptance is the first step. And the next step is about realising that taking care of IT in-house probably doesn’t provide the best results for your business. </p>



<p>And maybe it is time to outsource your IT needs.</p>



<p>After all, you have a lawyer to take care of the legal side of your organisation, and you hire an accountant to look after your finances – so how is technology any different? Especially when it comes to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly/">implementing IT that is highly effective, reliable and efficient</a>.</p>



<p>But the key is finding an MSP (managed service provider) who doesn’t just provide a help desk for problems and buys hardware – they need to be someone who can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">work with your business</a> to understand your strategy, and can offer expert advice on how IT can assist to achieve those goals.</p>



<p>By staying up to date with technology, understanding its importance in relation to productivity and business growth, and being <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">open to new IT offerings</a> that are available, 2020 could be your year to achieve success for your organisation.</p>



<p><strong>And what could be much more valuable than that?</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Are you getting ‘bang for your buck’ from your IT company? If you’ve been working with the same company for a long time, you might want to conduct an audit to ensure you are still being provided with great service when compared to other suppliers on the market.</p>



<p>This may feel slightly awkward, but it makes good business sense – and your IT company need not know that this is what you’re doing. Through careful observation and asking the right questions, you can gauge if you’re still being well-looked after – or if you need to shop around for another supplier.</p>



<p>Below are five simple tips to get your audit off to a great start.</p>



<h2>5 Steps to Audit Your Existing IT Provider</h2>



<h3>1. Revisit the paperwork</h3>



<p>Dust off the initial contract you signed with your IT supplier and see if they are still providing you with the stellar service they promised at the beginning. Some things may have slipped over the years without you realising.</p>



<p>By taking a look at the contract, you can identify any gaps in service and take note of areas for improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-should-set-kpis-for-your-it-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why you should set KPIs for your IT company</a></p>



<h3>2. Increase communication</h3>



<p>As the old saying goes, ‘the squeaky wheel always gets the oil’.</p>



<p>If you hardly ever check in with your IT company, they might presume you’re happy with the level of service and divert some of their resources elsewhere.</p>



<p>Start reaching out more and monitor their response. Are they proactive and willing to help? Or do they take days to reply to a simple email?</p>



<h3>3. Introduce KPIs</h3>



<p>As&nbsp;discussed in a previous blog post, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-you-should-set-kpis-for-your-it-company/">introducing KPIs</a> is a great way to hold your IT company accountable for the service they promise to provide.</p>



<p>You wouldn’t go years without measuring the performance of your employees, so try to think of external contractors in the same light. The KPIs don’t need to be complicated or difficult; they are merely a way to agree on your expectations, in writing, so your IT supplier is aware of the level of service you require.</p>



<h3>4. Assess their readiness for growth</h3>



<p>When you were first starting out, you would have chosen an IT supplier that was perfectly suited to a small start-up.</p>



<p>Now that you are a fully-fledged business with several employees and big goals, you need to check whether your IT company can keep up with the pace of your growth. Do they have the infrastructure and resources to help you innovate? If not, it might be time to move on.</p>



<h3>5. Reevaluate&nbsp;rates</h3>



<p>Since entering into an agreement with your IT supplier, the ‘going rate’ for IT assistance may have fluctuated slightly. There is the chance that another company may be able to offer you the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-do-i-find-the-right-level-of-services-for-my-it-budget/">same level of service for a lower price</a>, or that some more innovative players may have entered the market.</p>



<p>There’s no harm in shopping around and asking other IT providers for a quote, just to see what else is out there. Even if you do decide to stick with your current supplier, it’s always good to have an idea of where the market is heading for future reference.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-right-it-partner-for-your-business/">benefits of outsourcing your IT services</a> are numerous, and go far beyond saving time and money (although these are great perks!). So what is the top advantage of outsourcing?</p>



<p>It could be argued that the true value lies in the expert knowledge IT providers can bring to your business – the type of knowledge and experience that it’s very hard to put a price on.</p>



<p>Although it can be tempting to manage IT services in house, it could take you years to become proficient enough to do this with ease, confidence and expert ability. Just think of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-keep-up-to-date-with-technological-changes-affecting-a-business/">everything you would have to learn</a>!</p>



<p>Even if you hired another staff member to manage all of your IT needs, they might still struggle to keep on top of the workload, due to the extremely fast-paced, ever-changing nature of the digital world.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-recognise-its-time-for-your-business-to-outsource-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to recognise it&#8217;s time for your business to outsource IT</a></p>



<p>An experienced IT provider, on the other hand, will have all the tools and knowledge to look after all of your technology needs from day one – and they will have a whole team of experts dedicated to ensuring your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-do-you-bring-on-new-technology-to-grow-your-business-in-a-sophisticated-manner/">business’ technology requirements are met</a>. What you’re really paying for is years and years of hands-on experience.</p>



<p>Of course, this is only the case if you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/what-to-expect-from-outsourced-it-are-you-getting-bang-for-your-buck/">work with an MSP</a> (Managed Service Provider) who goes above and beyond simply fixing IT problems as they arise, setting up new user accounts and buying computers, and so on.</p>



<p>In order to unlock the true value of outsourcing your IT services, you want to partner with an MSP that is proactive and is consistently looking for ways improve your IT infrastructure and overall IT strategy – an MSP which takes a ‘big picture’ approach to IT management.</p>



<p>The right MSP will need to have a strong understanding of your business, your goals and be willing to provide solutions about how you can best harness the power of technology to get the results you want. They will also need to be up-to-date with all current technology trends and be thinking of ways to strategically implement these trends within your business.</p>



<p>If you work with a proactive MSP, all of the other key benefits of outsourcing will follow, such as time savings and cost savings. You want to get to a point where you can completely trust your MSP to come up with – and implement – <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/business-technology-you-should-be-implementing/">effective IT solutions</a> so that you can focus on other areas of the business which need attention.</p>



<p>This is the beauty of outsourcing; you don’t need to be across everything at once. To be successful in business in the digital age, you do not need to wear every single hat – you just need to make sure you form partnerships with the right hat-wearers.</p>



<p>So, to reiterate – although the benefits of outsourcing IT are far and wide, the true value lies in the expert knowledge an MSP can bring to your business. This is a huge investment in your future, and in your business’ ability to keep pace with technology – and is well worth the price of admission.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to have an <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cost-effective-it-how-to-manage-the-budget/">IT budget</a> that would expand as you needed it too? </p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is an unlikely scenario for most businesses, particularly small-to-medium-sized enterprises that typically have tight budgets attached to each area of their operations – which are set in stone for the next 12  months. </p>



<h2>3 Steps to Determine What Your Business Needs</h2>



<h3>Step 1: Prioritize</h3>



<p>List down what you want to achieve in your business and prioritize it. No &#8220;multiple&#8221; priorities are allowed. List them down, then assign a number from 1, with it being the highest. </p>



<p>Understanding what is important to your business, to help it operate efficiently and achieve growth, is the critical first step to finding the right level of services for the budget you have. </p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-much-spend-on-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">How much should you be spending on IT in 2020?</a> </p>



<h3>Step 2: Research</h3>



<p>And next is about knowing what kind of technology is actually out there  – as you may not have changed the way your business has done things in a long time, but new applications, hardware and software arrive on the market every day, and they might be just what you need to create greater efficiency (and in turn cost savings) in your day-to-day operations. </p>



<p>Research is vital to get a good understanding of what’s on offer. This may be done by searching online and speaking to different IT experts who cover a cross-section of capabilities. </p>



<p>And if you really want to ensure you are getting the best service for the budget you have,  you need to compare services and have a good knowledge of what technology would suit your business. </p>



<h3>Step 3: Align</h3>



<p>Then, once you know what you need, it is easier to pinpoint those companies that can provide the service to you – and it will also give you a better ability to negotiate terms and cost. </p>



<p>Depending on how complex your organisation’s technology requirements  are, you might also like to follow incorporate <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.accenture.com/t20151003T004643__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Strategy_4/Accenture-IT-Cost-Reduction-Using-New-Technology.pdf#zoom=50" target="_blank">AccentureStrategy’s model for cost reduction</a>; </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hub/668829/hubfs/Blog_Images/cost_reduction.png?t=1498446889595&amp;width=1114&amp;name=cost_reduction.png" alt="4 waves of IT cost reduction" title="How Do I Find the Right Level of Services for My IT Budget? 5"><figcaption>For further info on these four steps,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.accenture.com/t20151003T004643__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/Accenture/Conversion-Assets/DotCom/Documents/Global/PDF/Strategy_4/Accenture-IT-Cost-Reduction-Using-New-Technology.pdf#zoom=50" target="_blank">check out this PDF</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Feeling overwhelmed? What might be an interesting comparison is looking into whether outsourcing your IT needs to one provider is actually more cost-effective than having to liaise and use a variety of suppliers. </p>
