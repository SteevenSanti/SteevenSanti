<p>SMBs often struggle to compete with big brands. Apart from having bigger budgets, the main reason for this is big brands have discovered a secret — something that SMBs are still figuring out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern and successful New Zealand businesses have three things in common:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>More productive than others</li><li>At low risk of getting hacked and breached</li><li>Laser-focused on their customers</li></ol>



<p>As you may have noticed, the successful ones <strong>don’t fight fires everyday</strong>. They focus on the future, rather than on simply surviving the now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the idea is easy to grasp, it’s difficult to achieve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, there has to be systems in place — for everything. That’s how McDonald’s or Starbucks can simply open up a new store and produce the same burger or Frappucino the same way, no matter where you order it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, this takes time to develop. You can’t achieve these qualities overnight. You have to put in the time and effort. You need to invest in people and the right infrastructure and systems. And you need to make it stick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With that said, let’s explore the three qualities more of modern and successful New Zealand businesses below.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3 Qualities of Modern and Successful New Zealand Businesses</h2>



<h3>1. Increased Productivity</h3>



<p>Modern and successful businesses — those who’ve developed an unfair advantage — are more productive than their counterparts. Apple and Google have employees&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3068771/how-employees-at-apple-and-google-are-more-productive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40% more productive than the average company</a>. While there are a lot of factors discussed in that research, what’s important to note is that this increased productivity gives them an edge over other companies.</p>



<p>According to a Bain &amp; Company partner Michael Mankins, “They get more done by 10 a.m. Thursday morning than the others do in a week, but they don’t stop working.”</p>



<h4>Questions to ask yourself:</h4>



<ul><li>Are you constantly hitting your deadlines or missing them?</li><li>What about campaigns or product launches — are you on time? Or always late? Always remember to consider opportunity costs.&nbsp;<ul><li>If you’re set to launch a product/service on March, but got delayed for 3 months, you lost any potential revenue you could have earned during those 3 months. And this doesn’t even include the additional costs you spent during those extra 3 months.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>What’s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/automation-is-changing-everything/">causing inefficiencies</a> in your organization? Is it because of the people? The tools and systems?&nbsp;</li><li>Can you <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">work on-the-go</a>? Or do you have to stay in your office in front of your computer in order to do anything?&nbsp;</li><li>Are duplicate files and multiple file versions an issue you face each day?&nbsp;</li><li>Can you easily find other documents, or do you spend hours tracking and locating them?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>2. Reduced Security Risks</h3>



<p>Another quality of modern and successful businesses is they have reduced security risks. In other words, they are not in danger or at risk of getting their data stolen or hacked.</p>



<p>As you may already know,&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;is always in the news regardless of industry:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1 data breach</a>&nbsp;that leaked over 1.2 billion unique combinations of email addresses and passwords</li><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">Canva and PDL Data breach</a> which gives hackers </li><li><a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12026395" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica Scandal</a></li><li><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/toyota-cyber-attack-leaves-employees-unable-to-access-emails-for-days-20190221-p50z70.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Car manufacturer getting locked out of their email system</a></li></ul>



<p>Whether in the personal or social setting, manufacturing or automative industry, or even healthcare —&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">these hacks and breaches are only going to increase over time</a>. That’s why it’s important to have systems and processes in place to prevent and reduce the damages in the event of a cyber attack.</p>



<h4>Questions to ask yourself:</h4>



<ul><li>In the event of a cyber attack, are you prepared to deal with it? <ul><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">Ransomware</a> — where your files get locked up and you can’t access them</li><li><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019/">Data breach</a> — where sensitive data (yours or your customers) is stolen and leaked to the public </li><li>DoS — where you can’t gain access to your systems (e.g. getting locked out of your email server, or your website stops working, etc.) </li></ul></li><li>Are your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">staff knowledgeable on the most common cyber attacks</a> and trained to discern them?</li><li>Do you have the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">technology</a> in place to help you thwart such attacks?</li><li>How will you communicate to your customers when their sensitive information gets stolen? </li><li>How are you going to recover your data when they get deleted or gets encrypted (ransomware)? </li><li>How long will it take you to resume business after a disaster? Do you have <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">backups</a> and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly/">recovery systems</a> in place? </li></ul>



<h3>3. Customer-Focused</h3>



<p>Finally, the third quality of modern and successful companies is they have the ability to focus on their customers instead of worrying something that isn’t in their core business.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110436476581112426" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Drucker</a>, one of the greatest management thinkers of the 21st century, said that “results are only on the outside.” This was in the context of most leaders tend to focus on internal processes and systems vs what happens on the outside — customers, partners, the economy, trends, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Successful companies focus on the outside, not on issues within the company like inefficiencies and frustrations brought about by legacy systems.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Questions to ask yourself:</h4>



<ul><li>Are there recurring issues that you and your staff face daily? Like printers not working, computers slowing down or not opening at all, internet connectivity problems, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Do certain activities take more than necessary to accomplish certain tasks?&nbsp;</li><li>Are internal issues — IT, accounting, or reporting performance — keeping you from serving your customers?&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>



<p>Modern and successful New Zealand businesses all have these three qualities: they’re more productive, low security risks, and customer-focused. They don’t spend their limited resources fighting fires.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, they focus on what really matters. They focus on their customers. They focus on the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To succeed in today’s highly competitive environment, you need to be forward-looking. Instead of doing more of the same, you need to adapt to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you use <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_08.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Porter’s Five Forces</a> — a framework for analyzing a company, market, or industry — you’ll realize that the market is more saturated than ever with tons of alternatives/ substitutes, and changing buyer’s behaviors. </p>



<p>It is, therefore, imperative that businesses today <strong>strive to develop an unfair advantage</strong> in their industry or market in order to become successful. </p>



<h2>3 Challenges Every New Zealand Business Must Overcome</h2>



<h3>Challenge 1: More Competition</h3>



<p>A quick-and-dirty analysis using Porter’s 5 Forces reveals that almost every industry are in
the same situation. But before that, here’s a quick recap on the five forces:
</p>



<ol><li> <strong>Competitive rivalry</strong> — looks at the number and strength of your competitors. When rivalry is intense, companies often attract customers using price cuts. But when there’s minimal (or no) competition, the stronger your position is with healthy profits. </li><li> <strong><g class="gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="21" data-gr-id="21">Threat</g> of new entrants</strong> — refers to the ability of other people to enter your market. If it takes little money and effort to enter your market, or if others can replicate the technology you’re using, then rivals can quickly enter your market and weaken your position. </li><li> <strong><g class="gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="12" data-gr-id="12">Threat</g> of substitutes</strong> — the likelihood of your customers finding a different way of doing what you offer. If what you do can be replaced by something else available in the market, what’s stopping your customers from doing so? </li><li><strong>Bargaining power of buyers</strong> — how many buyers do you have and how big are their orders? How much would it cost them to switch to your competitors? When you deal with a few buyers, they have more power to dictate terms to you. </li><li> <strong>Bargaining power of sellers</strong> — how easy is it for your suppliers to increase their prices; how many suppliers do you have? The fewer suppliers there are, the more you need their help and the stronger their position and their ability to charge you more. </li></ol>



<p>This framework is often used to determine an industry’s attractiveness or assess the company in terms of its environment. </p>



<p>Take, for example, a fictional web development company called Best Web Agency. If you look at the competitors within the segment, there are a lot of them. There are <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="5" data-gr-id="5">indi- vidual</g> freelancers, companies <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">and</g> agencies doing website development services. </p>



<p>The barriers to entry in this industry are also individual. Anyone with design and programming experience can start offering these kinds of services. </p>



<p>In addition, there are a lot of drag-and-drop website builders that can act as an alternative
to the services Best Web Agency can offer. There are countless pre-built templates regard-
less of which platform the user chooses. All these factors make it difficult to stand out in
this market.
</p>



<h3>Challenge 2: People’s Buying Behavior Has Changed </h3>



<p>The internet has also changed the way people buy — both online and offline. It decentralized the buying process in that businesses can no longer withhold information that may prove useful in the buying cycle without it affecting them negatively later on. </p>



<p>For example, before the internet, buying a laptop means going to a store, talking to sales
people, and deciding on which model to purchase.
</p>



<p>Salespeople can opt not to share some important pieces of information like battery life or
power consumption, which may make some buyers hesitate. But with the internet, con-
sumers no longer <em>need </em>to ask and get these information from salespeople. They just search
for reviews online and make their decisions long before talking to someone from your com-
pany.
</p>



<h3>Challenge 3: Looming Online Threat
</h3>



<p>In addition, there is a continued rise of a new kind of threat — cyber attacks. With more and
more people relying on using the internet for their daily needs, it’s imperative that you equip
not only yourself with the knowledge and tools but also your staff.
</p>



<p>More than <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">84% of cyber security breaches</a> were caused by human error. This means that even if you are careful yourself, your staff might not have the same level of awareness. </p>



<p>In addition, about 70% of all SMBs have been targeted by a cyber attack in 2018. Unfortunately, most of them didn’t realize and weren’t prepared for these attacks. </p>



<p>These three challenges have to be faced by New Zealand business owners like you if you want to remain competitive, relevant, and successful. You must strive to develop an unfair advantage in your own industry. </p>
