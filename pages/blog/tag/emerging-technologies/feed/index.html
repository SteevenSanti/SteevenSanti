										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Does your business have an unfair advantage in today’s competitive environment? Or are you simply “getting by” or “barely surviving”? </p>



<p>Is your business thriving in today’s digital age? Or are you still relying on outdated technology while your competitors are investing in new, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">emerging technologies</a>? </p>



<p>We all know that the market is constantly changing. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/3-undeniable-challenges-facing-new-zealand-businesses-today/">Customers are always expecting more</a> from you — more value for less money. </p>



<p>The only way to remain relevant is to adapt to these changes. </p>



<p>And that means your business has to go through a digital transformation. </p>



<h2>What Is Digital Transformation</h2>



<p>Now, what exactly is digital transformation? </p>



<p>For most people, it’s about going paperless. And while going paperless is definitely a part of it, digital transformation goes beyond that, especially if you look at it from an organizational perspective. </p>



<p>Digital transformation is the use of new, fast, and frequently changing digital technologies to create — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. </p>



<h2>Digital Transformation Examples</h2>



<p>An easy way to understand digital transformation is to look at our personal lives. Below are three examples of how digital transformation has completely permeated our lives. </p>



<h3>Example 1: File Storage</h3>



<p>Before, if you want to save the photos and files in your computers and phones, you would have to buy an external hard drive. But now, because of the availability of online storage providers services, you don’t need to buy that hard drive anymore. Some popular brands out there are Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, and iCloud. </p>



<h3>Example 2: Movies and Entertainment</h3>



<p>Or let’s say you wanted to watch a movie that isn’t on the big screen right now. </p>



<p>Today, you would just open up your Netflix or Hulu or Amazon account, and you can stream any movie or TV series available. </p>



<p>For those who aren’t familiar, there was a time where you would have to go to a video store, buy or rent a DVD or VHS, go back to your house, and plug it into a specific player before you can watch that movie. </p>



<p>After which you’ll have to return it (if you only rented it), or find a place at home to store all those CDs. </p>



<h3>Example 3: Music</h3>



<p>This goes the same for music. </p>



<p>Before Spotify and (insert name here), the only way for you go get your music is to buy them from record stores. The latest medium for music before it went <em>digital</em> is in the form of CDs as well. Before that, they were in cassettes. </p>



<p>And just like playing movies, you’d have bought a specific player for you to play your music. Heard of the Sony Walkman? </p>



<p>Now, we can do all the things we listed above (and more) with just our phones. That’s how much digital transformation has influenced our lives. </p>



<p>But this doesn’t seem to be the case for businesses. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Digital transformation is the use of new, fast, and frequently changing digital technologies to create — or modify existing — business processes, culture, and customer experiences to meet changing business and market requirements. </p></blockquote>



<h2>Digital Transformation for Businesses</h2>



<p>Another way to look at digital transformation is by using cloud computing while reducing reliance on user-owned hardware. This is what we’ll be focusing on— <strong>The ROI to businesses when they invest in digital transformation</strong>. </p>



<p>One of the reasons why most New Zealand businesses haven’t invested in digital transformation goes back to IT service providers like us. Oftentimes, we make such a big deal out of it that it makes things complicated for people like you. </p>



<p>That’s why most business leaders stay away from it. Instead, they rely on what is familiar to them. </p>



<p>Technology has permeated every aspect of our personal lives. We have powerful computers in our pockets, smart devices, and home automation systems. </p>



<p>But in the workplace, a lot of businesses are still using technology like it was in the 90s or early 2000s. </p>



<p>In today’s fast-changing world, it becomes critical to adapt to these changes. Otherwise, you’d get left behind. </p>



<p>No doubt you have heard of stories of big brands becoming irrelevant simply because they failed to adapt to these changes. They conducted business as if it was status quo while the rest of the market changed. </p>



<p>They <strong>chose to ignore</strong> that the times are changing and that’s the reason why they failed. </p>



<p><a href="http://content.quanton.co.nz/blog/the-digital-revolution-its-not-about-technology?utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=79515284&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--21Hs00AsJTXl1K-qYqu81e71nzFWiaOj-dZ080Kcbyun9Ih12Zgdiuu20qYq92eP6jDKtIsub_OSkgHO5jkrnnVBs2g&amp;_hsmi=79515284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Technology is not the solution by itself</a>. Rather, it’s a tool that will allow you to overcome the challenges you’re facing in your business right now. </p>



<p>Digital transformation is a complex topic, but it doesn’t have to be. We broke down digital transformation into four separate categories. </p>



<p>Here’s a quick overview&#8230;<br></p>



<h2>Overview of Digital Transformation</h2>



<h3>No. 1: Build a Strong Foundation</h3>



<p>First, you’ll need to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/build-strong-foundation/">build a strong foundation</a>. </p>



<p>As you already know, <strong>implementing change in your business is difficult</strong>. Without the commitment from top management, people don’t put in enough effort to make the change succeed. Without input from the end-users, new technology is often seen as a fad, pushed down their throats — making it difficult to accept the change initiative, and at times, actively sabotage the initiative. </p>



<p>And just like when building a house, if you don’t start with a strong foundation, everything you put on top crumbles easily. </p>



<h3>No. 2: Cloud-Based Email: Higher Productivity at Lower Costs</h3>



<p>After setting up a strong foundation, the next step is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cloud-based-email/">migrate your email to the cloud</a>. If you’re new to using cloud technology, this is the easiest transition you can make. </p>



<p>The main goal here is a <strong>seamless transition</strong> from your email server to a cloud-based one. Your staff leaves the office on Friday afternoon. They come back on Monday morning as if nothing happened. </p>



<p>Using a cloud-based email will help your organisation be more productive while lowering your costs. Now, that’s a good investment. </p>



<h3>No. 3: Work Better: Implementing a Hub for Teamwork</h3>



<p>It’s no secret that the faster you adapt to the changing customer demands, the better your business will be in the long-run. </p>



<p>The simplest way for your entire organisation to adapt faster is to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/work-better-implementing-hub-for-teamwork/">communicate faster and work more efficiently</a>. And the tool that will help you achieve that is a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/">collaboration and communication software</a>. </p>



<h3>No. 4: Shared Storage for Everyone: Never Deal with Duplicates Again</h3>



<p>Ever find yourself looking for a file — whether that’s a report or a spreadsheet — and you end up searching for 15 minutes and you still couldn’t find the one you’re looking for? </p>



<p>Or what about that time where you couldn’t figure out which version is the real “final” version because there are dozens of files with the word “final” in the filename. </p>



<p>These frustrations are common in every organisation. And the easiest way to make sure you find what you’re looking for and not waste your time searching over and over is to use a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again/">shared cloud storage</a> for all your files and documents. </p>



<h2>Over to You</h2>



<p>If you want to remain competitive and relevant in your industry, you have to accept the reality that status quo isn’t acceptable. </p>



<p>The market is always changing. That’s why you should also be changing. </p>



<p>If you don’t do something, you will get left behind.</p>

<p>Running a business in the digital age is fast-paced, exciting and – let’s be honest – a little overwhelming. Do you feel like every time you wrap your head around a new technology, something else springs up in its place?</p>



<p>Keeping <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">up-to-date with the technological changes</a> affecting a business&nbsp;can feel like a full-time job. Fortunately, we know a few shortcuts.</p>



<p>See below for ways you can stay informed without losing sleep – or your sanity.</p>



<h2>3 Ways to Stay Updated with Technological Changes</h2>



<h3>1. Focus, focus, focus</h3>



<p>A common mistake many business leaders make is believing they need to understand every new technological breakthrough that hits the market. In reality, you only need to focus on the technologies that could have an impact on your business. For example, if you don’t sell products, you don’t need to know about the latest discovery in inventory management software.</p>



<p>So how can you narrow down your focus? The first step is to <strong>make a list</strong> of all the things that are important to your business.</p>



<p>Keep this list and refer to it every time a technology news story hits your desk. If it doesn’t relate to your business, or your growth strategy, then you can safely ignore it.</p>



<p>The second step is to focus on the sources which provide you with the most valuable, relevant information, and read them religiously – more on how to do this below.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/business-technology-you-should-be-implementing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Business technology you should be implementing in 2020</a></p>



<h3>2. Do your research online</h3>



<p>The internet should be your first port of call for research on business technology. As it does offer an overwhelming amount of information, the key is, once again, to focus.</p>



<p>Find a handful of excellent websites or blogs that offer the most value. Sign up to their newsletters, like them on social media and make a point to read all of the new material they publish – but ignore everything else.</p>



<p>Following 2-4 reputable, informative website is far more effective than trying to read every news article ever published.</p>



<p>Finding the right sites for you will take some research. Ask your colleagues for recommendations, run a Google Search and keep your eyes and ears open for sources that align with your business goals.</p>



<p>One way to narrow down your options is to <strong>consider how you best learn</strong>. For example, do you prefer reading in-depth articles or browsing informative infographics? Or perhaps you prefer to watch short, sharp videos?</p>



<p>Try to pick websites which you find engaging, as you’ll be more likely to read them regularly.</p>



<h3>3. Work with an IT expert you can trust</h3>



<p>Sometimes, no matter how much you want to keep up with new technologies, the reality is: there’s just not enough hours in the day. If you don’t have time to read blogs and newsletters, it’s a good idea to recruit an IT expert who can stay on top of new technologies on your behalf.</p>



<p>If you do go down this road, make sure you work with an IT expert or company who you can trust will bring new technologies to your attention. You want to relax in the knowledge that they will encourage you to update your IT systems as and when is necessary. That way, you can concentrate your energy on other areas of the business while enjoying peace of mind that your technology is up-to-date.</p>

<p>In a lot of small-to-medium-sized businesses, where <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cost-effective-it-how-to-manage-the-budget/">IT budgets</a> are&nbsp;typically tight, it is quite common for upgrades and improvements to be made only when there is an emergency – for example when current systems get overloaded, old software or hardware fails, or there isn’t the right technology available to employees.</p>



<p>And even when the problem is discovered, usually the solution (because of time or budget constraints) is just a patch or a quick fix.</p>



<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/why-business-intelligence-is-changing-the-face-of-sme-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Business Intelligence is changing the face of SME business</a></p>



<p>Sure, in the short-term this provides the desired effect, but long-term, what does it mean&nbsp;for your business? </p>



<p>It means you have systems and processes that aren’t robust or <a href="https://it360.co.nz/futureproof/">future-proofed</a> because it is likely the same thing will occur in another few years, where you will find your business in the same situation again – and that is neither productive or cost-effective.</p>



<p>So if 2020 is the year to bring your businesses IT systems up to date, then follow these steps below.</p>



<h2>5 Steps to Bring New Technology in Your Business</h2>



<h3>Step 1: Prioritise</h3>



<p>First, you need to prioritise what is most important for your&nbsp;business – is it new hardware that is most needed to carry out your operations, or is better software required to improve&nbsp;your output?</p>



<p>You probably can’t do everything at once – so it is important to concentrate on the most urgent priority and then work your way down the list. This way it won’t feel as overwhelming either, and you can make sure you don’t blow the budget in the first few months of the year.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Reverse engineer</h3>



<p>Once you know what technology it is that you need, it is a good idea to reverse engineer from the ideal goal, to how you will actually reach it.&nbsp;Otherwise, you could just end up with another piece-meal approach that often occurs from things not being planned out properly.</p>



<p>If you have a business of 100 staff, and you would like to equip everyone with a new computer, then that might not be achievable right away. You should find out how much the total cost is going to be, work that into your budget over a 12 to 24 month period (or whatever works for your business), and have a solid set out plan of how the implementation of the new technology into your company will occur.</p>



<p>Calculating ROI is always a good idea for any business too, as you want to know how what you are doing is actually making a difference to your organisation (and for reporting purposes to shareholders/governance boards).</p>



<h3>Step 3: Softly, softly</h3>



<p>This is about remaining patient and understanding that technology changes in your business will most likely take a bit of time. Remember, you can’t do everything at once, but that shouldn’t stop you from starting somewhere, and then taking the softly, softly approach to furthering your plans and changes for the business.</p>

</div>



<h3>Step 4: Get expert input</h3>



<p>If IT isn’t your area of expertise, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-get-the-right-it-partner-for-your-business/">find someone who knows their stuff</a>.</p>



<p>These types of decisions aren’t ones you should make&nbsp;on your own, without the guidance of someone who can point out all the possible pros and cons to what you want to do. </p>



<p>Engage with an IT professional who can&nbsp;provide&nbsp;some valuable opinions on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/farro-fresh-implements-new-network-solution-partners-with-kordia/">implementing new technology</a> into your business.</p>



<h3>Step 5: Follow best practices</h3>



<p>Time to bring on the new IT systems in your business? In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accesscorp.com/best-practices-for-implementing-new-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article here from Archive Systems</a>, it says you should follow three best practice guidelines to getting the most out of implementing new technology.</p>



<h4>1. Set SMART on-boarding goals</h4>



<p>Ensure you get the most out of your technology by identifying&nbsp;SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, results-orientated and time-bound) goals and then pair them with your business metrics.</p>



<h4>2. Make it accessible</h4>



<p>Everyone learns differently, meaning different learning styles, at a different pace, and with different needs. </p>



<p>Make sure your training for the new software meets the variation in learning needs&nbsp;and is also accessible when your employees need it .</p>



<h4>3. Blend your training</h4>



<p>For the best results from your on boarding, always blend your training. By providing a combination of in-person and online support for your employees, you will be able to make the most of the time and dollars spent in-person with a&nbsp;trainer.</p>

<p>Technology in business isn’t just about serving your internal functions and processes – well it shouldn’t be. More organisations are turning to IT to help them look after their customers and clients better, and that’s how it should be, as that’s how a business grows. </p>

</div>


<h2>5 Business Technology You Should Be Implementing</h2>



<h3>1. Big Data</h3>



<p>Over the past few years, big data has been a significant trend in the business landscape as more organisations start to realise its power – if it is collected and used in the right way. </p>



<p>This example here&nbsp;shows how a <a href="https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/social-media-metrics-using-big-data-and-social-media-improve-retail-customer-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retailer can use big data</a> to predict trends, prepare for demand and optimise pricing and promotions. Which of course provides them with an advantage over competitors who only operate in a reactive manner. </p>



<p>It helps create more satisfied customers who feel like their needs are not only being met but in many ways predicted by companies, they choose to buy from. </p>

<h3>2. User experience (UX) and customer experience (CX)</h3>



<p>Encompassing a variety of offerings, user and customer experience is about making sure that the end-user is always in mind for the development of tools and services. </p>



<p>UX and CX is already a strategy for leading companies and marketers who know that providing customers (and potential customers) with an enjoyable experience when interacting with a business is a vital component of a service offering. </p>



<p>Even on a small budget, it is imperative that businesses consider how they are able to incorporate UX and CX into the way they engage with new leads, turn them into customers, and then continue to delight them (and ultimately&nbsp;retain them for longer). </p>



<h3>3. Mobile-first</h3>



<p>If you don’t currently cater towards the mobile market, then it needs to be high on your list of priorities for 2019 – otherwise, your business will be left behind, literally. </p>



<p>In May 2015 Google announced that searches&nbsp;on mobile had surpassed PCs, and around the same time they introduced a&nbsp;new search algorithm&nbsp;that favoured mobile-friendly websites over those who were not optimised for mobile browsing. </p>



<p>But even if Google favouring mobile-friendly websites doesn’t bother you, having a design that is easy to navigate on a tablet or mobile device should be a concern as it links back to point 2 around user experience. </p>



<h3>4. Document management &amp; CRM</h3>



<p>According to&nbsp;this article from Business2Community,  both document management and CRM systems will become more&nbsp;cloud-based,  mobile-friendly, and inherently collaborative in 2019, which is a  win-win when it comes to catering to your customer&#8217;s needs. Companies will continue to see the benefits of these solutions that allow them to work more efficiently and most importantly to meet the needs of consumers – who expect to have personalised service when dealing with businesses they interact with. </p>



<h3>5. Apps</h3>



<p>Applications for mobile devices are no longer reserved for the super technical, and they don’t have to cost the earth either. Now easily accessible for small-to-medium-sized businesses, they offer an opportunity to&nbsp;provide a point of difference to customers, clients and consumers. </p>



<p>Business planning and strategy company Bplan says that&nbsp;creating an  active and well-functioning app for your small business that lives on your customers’ phones gives your brand the prestige and credibility that was once reserved for big businesses. </p>



<p>An added bonus is that they can also allow a level of user&nbsp;self-management, meaning there could be a large amount of time taken off in-house administration for small tasks – for example, contact changes, making bookings, receiving notifications/business updates. &#8212;&#8212;&#8211; <strong>Keen to understand more about Cyber Security in the Workplace? <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE</a>!</strong></p>

<p>Business applications (apps) come in all shapes and sizes, and using them in your organisation could provide some real benefits. They are nothing new in terms of their concept, but you should make an effort in 2020 to really see how much value they can bring to your daily operations. </p>



<p>Here are six apps we think you should consider to help increase productivity and overall efficiency in your business. </p>



<h2>6 Apps That Can Increase Your Productivity</h2>



<h3><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-teams/" target="_blank">1. Microsoft Teams</a></h3>



<p>Microsoft Teams is a freemium application that works to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/top-collaboration-software-for-new-zealand-businesses/">help teams communicate with each</a> other easier – particularly if in different offices or locations. </p>



<p>You can create various channels for each area of the business, where people can collaborate, and there is also a private message function for one-on-one discussions. Removing the hassle of trying to follow email chains and attending time-consuming meetings, it allows everyone to stay up-to-date with workflows and processes that relate to their job. </p>



<h3><a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2. Trello</a></h3>



<p>Trello is another free tool and it is perfect for project management. It can be as simple as a to-do list for an individual (to-do, in progress, waiting for feedback, complete), or is ideal for teams working on projects together – it provides a one glance view of where tasks are currently sitting, and everyone can input progress updates for other members to view. </p>



<h3><a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3. Spark</a></h3>



<p>We have previously mentioned how unproductive dealing with emails can be, but the good news is there are plenty of apps around that allow you to turn your inbox into an organised, functional place that you won’t be so afraid of. </p>



<p>Spark is one email management app that offers a Smart  Inbox that automatically sorts incoming mail into different folders, depending on how you set it up. You can also snooze selected emails until later, so if you can’t deal with them straight away, they will show back up at a time that is more convenient for you </p>



<h3><a href="https://trackingtime.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4. TrackingTime</a></h3>



<p>TrackingTime is a collaboration tool that enables accurate tracking of time spent on different tasks, so you can keep control over workflows.  </p>



<p>Allowing you to follow productivity when managing projects, it also takes you to the two next steps – generating timesheets and providing analytics so you can accurately measure outputs. </p>



<h3><a href="https://readdle.com/scannerpro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5. ScannerPro</a></h3>



<p>ScannerPro is a helpful little app to have around when you’re out of the office, or just want to have a less time-consuming way of scanning documents. It allows you to take a snapshot of a document and turn it into professional-looking PDFs which you can then email, add to the Cloud, or print out when you get back to the office. </p>



<p>Maybe it sounds like something too small to truly make a difference to your day, but these types of apps are about making life easier wherever they possibly can, and we can certainly all do with a bit of that in our working day. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.fetchpayments.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6. Fetch Payments</a></h3>



<p>Getting paid on time is the dream of most businesses, particularly SMEs who rely on prompt payments for managing cash flow. And there are plenty of apps out there that can assist with making sure the money is in your bank account when it is supposed to be, and there is less time spent on chasing up debtors. </p>



<p>Fetch is a KiwiBank application, but the good news is you don’t have to be a Kiwi Bank customer to use it. Whether you need to get paid online or on the job site, Fetch has multiple functions that allow you to collect money faster, whichever way you do business &#8211; and of course, it is about cutting down on the time required it takes to do it too.</p>
