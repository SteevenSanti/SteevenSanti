<p>Earlier last year, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> implemented a new network solution to improve their security architecture. As a solutions provider, we also partner with other companies who can supplement us with the services we need to  deliver value to our customers. </p>



<p>Enter Kordia. </p>



<p>Upon our recommendation, Farro partnered with Kordia to deploy a new wide area network (WAN). The project also included a new internet connectivity and a new phone system. Watch this interview as Brent La Franchie of Kordia and Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager of Farro Fresh, as they talk about the project. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_pvqi12mkpo videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>Kordia Background</h2>



<p>Brent starts off by saying, “Kordia has been around for 70 years. Kordia is known for its broadcasting capabilities, that&#8217;s where our pedigree is, and that&#8217;s where we came from.” </p>



<p>He then emphasizes the relationship Kordia and iT360 has in the past. It’s a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/case-study-farro-fresh-focus-on-customers-instead-of-security-issues-causing-inefficiencies/">recurring theme</a> that we often emphasize ourselves. </p>



<p>“iT360 Kordia actually have some personal roots that go a long way back. Our fathers worked together back in the technology age, way back in the 80s and 90s. I&#8217;m extremely proud that I can work alongside someone who my father worked alongside. We&#8217;re both very passionate about what we do. Both share a lot of the same values and we are both driven to get the same outcomes for our customers.”</p>



<h2>Security Issues That Need to Be Addressed</h2>



<p>Simon starts off by describing the security issues they were experiencing at Farro. </p>



<p>“In late 2017, we had some security issues, and our CEO, Bryce Howard had worked with iT360.” </p>



<p>The security issues faced by Farro hundred them from doing their work. As noted by Simon in <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/farro-fresh-protects-digital-technologies-using-watchguard/">another video</a>, nothing’s ever been compromised, but the incursions were preventing their staff to do their job properly. </p>



<p>He goes on to continue by sharing his impressions of us during the early stages of the relationship. </p>



<p>“There was an immediate level of confidence just from meeting with the guys and talking to them about what we wanted out of the relationship and what they could bring to the table.” </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Brent talks more about the solution and how it was implemented&#8230;</p>



<p>“So that solution was a new wide area network, Awareness we call it. New internet connectivity, new phone system, and also some new security architecture.”</p>



<p>“One of the clear directives was how do we transition them, to this new fantastic network, without disrupting their everyday business? So between iT360 and Kordia, we implemented a network, which sat alongside their existing network infrastructure. And then once ready, we cut that network over to the new network.” </p>



<p>While this may sound simple on the surface, this involved a lot of moving parts from three different parties. Despite this, the switch was successful and didn’t create any disturbance in the operations of Farro Fresh. </p>



<h2>The Results: Simon Looks Back at the Partnership</h2>



<p>“The choice IT360 had made to partner with Kordia for us was the right one,” said Simon. “And the expertise Kordia had available was phenomenal. Throughout the whole process, we always felt that we were listened to. And the focus of my job has changed from fire fighting and repair to planning and future projects.” </p>



<p>“If I had to describe the relationship with IT360 and the partners; productive, honest, open and to a certain degree absolutely invisible, and that&#8217;s the best kind.”</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a> was experiencing security issues that hindered them from serving their customers. Fed up with this, they started looking for ways to improve the security of their digital technologies. </p>



<p>When Farro approached us with this issue, we recommended to work with one of our long-time partners, WatchGuard. </p>



<p>Here’s an interview that talks about the problems Farro was having and how WatchGuard helped. </p>



<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">
<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">
<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_9kktqkmu89 videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>



<div style="height:50px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2>WatchGuard Background</h2>



<p>Kurt Brandon, Sales Manager, start off by sharing some background on WatchGuard.</p>



<p>“So, WatchGuard have been in business for 20 plus years. We&#8217;re one of the original developers of hardware firewalls and our focus all those years has been the small to medium business market&#8230;Also, on distributed enterprise of which Farro comes into that market.” </p>



<h2>The Importance of Digital Technologies</h2>



<p>As with most businesses today, digital technologies is very important. Yet, most businesses aren’t thinking about how they can protect them. </p>



<p>Until something happens. </p>



<p>Simon Foley, Data and IT Man<g class="gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="3" data-gr-id="3">a</g>ger of Farro, shares their experience with having security issues in the business and how it has impeded their ability to serve their customers. </p>



<p>“Farro is a supermarket chain. We have six stores around Auckland, about 350 staff at the moment.”</p>



<p>“Without digital technologies, we wouldn&#8217;t exist. Literally every part of the business we have, including alarms and notifications, is all about having a strong underlying, safe network.”</p>



<p>He then highlights the importance of <strong>proactively</strong> putting systems in place to protect these digital systems&#8230;</p>



<p>“Security is an ongoing concern in any company. Our business has experienced issues with security in the past, and they have impacted the business in quite some serious ways. Nothing&#8217;s ever been compromised, but it certainly had affected our ability to allow our staff to do their job properly.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Having the confidence in our IT partner to provide stuff that gives us security and confidence in our systems&#8230;[it] means that instead of spending the day worrying about what could happen, we can actually plan for the future of the business.</p><cite>Simon Foley, Data and IT Manager</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Early Beginnings of the Project</h2>



<p>When asked about his impressions of us, Simon says, “When we met with iT360 for the first time, in January 2018, our impressions of the guys were, that they were very professional, that they were of a size to help us, and that they had the skills and knowledge, and access to other people with their skills and knowledge, to actually provide us with the things that we were looking for.” </p>



<h2>iT360 and WatchGuard Partnership</h2>



<p>“iT360 are our long term Watchguard partner. They&#8217;ve been a gold partner for a number of years. And they also run our managed services offering,” says Kurt. </p>



<p>Having worked with WatchGuard for a long time, we are confident in their products. We also love working with them. That’s why when we were discussing the needs of Farro, we immediately know that WatchGuard is a partner we can bring in to help them with they <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security issues</a>. </p>



<p>“So when they were talking to Farro Fresh they approached me about how we would build a network for them, how we would deliver that, and from there, we viewed the compromise that they&#8217;d had and looked at how we would protect them going forward.”</p>



<h2>Future Proofing the Business</h2>



<p>After a year and a half, Farro has never encountered any security issue in their network. This eventually helped shift their perspective. Instead of worrying about security issues, they can now focus on the future. </p>



<p>“Having the confidence in our IT partner to provide stuff that gives us security and confidence in our systems&#8230;[it] means that instead of spending the day worrying about what could happen, we can actually plan for the future of the business.&#8221; </p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/cases/farro-fresh-grows-without-worrying-about-it-issues/">Farro Fresh</a>, a boutique supermarket chain, was experiencing security issues in their business. This prevented them from serving their customers fully. </p>

</div>
</div>
</div>



<p>Earlier this year, we interviewed Bryce Howard, CEO of Farro Fresh, about the challenges they were facing and where they are now after working with us. </p>



<h2>Farro Fresh Background</h2>



<p>“So we&#8217;re a boutique supermarket chain that has been set up in Auckland starting about 2006. And starting from one store, small beginning, 10 people, and from there we&#8217;ve grown to six supermarkets, have about 350 full-timers, and we&#8217;re covering most of Auckland.”  </p>



<p>Bryce then goes to explain the importance of digital technology to their business&#8230;</p>



<p>“The digital technology for Farro is imperative for our business. We need a system that is both stable and operational seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and without that, we won&#8217;t have a business.” </p>



<p>And as is often the case with most New Zealand businesses, they don’t think about protecting their data and other information&#8230;until something happens. </p>



<p>“The security aspect is quite interesting. You don&#8217;t realize how important it is until you have an incursion. We&#8217;ve certainly learned the hard way, learned a couple of times that the security of the network is of utmost importance.”</p>



<p>In fact, that’s <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">one of the most common myths</a> SMB owners came to believe in — “I’m a small business, no one would target me.” But as you may already know by now, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">most cyber attacks aren’t targeted</a>. </p>



<p>For example, the most common type of attack, email phishing, isn’t sent to a single person or a company. It’s sent to pretty much everyone in the cyber criminal’s database — which <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">most likely would include yours</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. </p><cite>Bryce Howard, CEO</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Importance of Relationships</h2>



<p>One of the feedback we often get from our customers is that we don’t treat them as clients; rather, treat them as family. But don’t just take our word for it. Check out our <a href="https://g.page/iT360" target="_blank">reviews on Google</a>.</p>



<p>David Wilson, iT360’s General Manager, talks about this relationship more. </p>



<p>“We came to work with Farro actually because of relationships. My father had been working with Bryce for many, many years back at Tasti Products, actually. He realized the situation of IT in the business at the time and reached out to us to help. Because of that relationship and the fact that Dad had built trust with Bryce over so many years, it just meant that Bryce could say to us, &#8220;I know you can take care of this job, and I trust you.&#8221; </p>



<h2>Systems Thinking vs Bandaid Solution</h2>



<p>We’ve been in the business for <a href="https://it360.co.nz/about/">over 25 years</a>. We’ve had our share of comments and feedback from various customers across different industries. </p>



<p>One of the most common issue we often hear is service providers (like us) often recommend solutions to fix the symptoms. And as you already know, targeting the symptoms vs the underlying solutions isn’t a good strategy. While it does seem ok in the short-term, eventually, this creates more problems for the business. </p>



<p>That’s why we always make sure we understand the situation fully before recommending something. </p>



<p>And that was the same thing with Farro. </p>



<p>Dave goes on to continue, “it was a business that actually needed something done in almost every area of IT, and we managed to achieve the entire project in a very, very short window of time, without impacting any operations.” </p>



<p>Recommending one thing might make the problem go away temporarily. But without a systemic approach, that problem will continue to rear its ugly head. </p>



<h2>Focus on Customers Instead of Internal Issues</h2>



<p>When asked about the results of working with iT360, Bryce said “For me, the key proof in the pudding is the fact that we don&#8217;t have to keep on thinking about the safety, security, or access of our computers.”</p>



<p>And that’s one of the criteria every supplier or vendor should be weighed against — do they allow you to focus on your core business instead of constantly putting out fires? Are the systems running and working the way they should? Or do these issues continue coming up? </p>



<p>Bryce continues, “We come in in the morning, we focus on making great products, selling to our customers, and we&#8217;re not having to worry about whether we&#8217;re having an incursion or a security issue. We&#8217;re continuing to have a great relationship and a great outcome from working with iT360.”</p>

<p>As systems evolve, security must evolve with it. Gone are the times when one computer would connect to one server or network. Now multiple devices want access to multiple networks all hours of the day and night. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">The linear line of security has morphed into a spider’s web of connectivity</a>.</p>



<p>What are the greatest challenges businesses face in this new information era, and how can you combat them?</p>



<h2>What Is Endpoint Security?</h2>



<p>Endpoint security is a network protection strategy (one of the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">crucial areas in cyber security</a> you need to protect in your business) that grants access to devices like desktops, laptops, tablets or phones that meet certain credentials. It takes needing a username and password one step further, so only approved, safe devices have access.</p>



<p>People use a mix of personal and company devices to get work done, and each has varying levels of security. Endpoint security’s main goal is to <strong>prevent a device without anti-virus software, an approved operating system or virtual private network (VPN) from logging on to your company network.</strong></p>



<h2>Top 3 Challenges in Endpoint Security</h2>



<h3>1. Keeping all devices up-to-date</h3>



<p>The challenge is keeping all devices up-to-date with your business’ <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/no-cyber-security-policy/">security policy</a> so everyone who needs access can have it and get work done. If it’s too strict, or people get lax on updates productivity will plummet as people become unable to log on and have access to the information they need to do their job.</p>



<h3>2. Ensure information is used correctly</h3>



<p>The amount of information flowing across networks is increasing daily. One of the biggest challenges to network security is <strong>protecting that information and make sure it’s being used correctly.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike endpoint security which focuses on preventing some devices from logging on, network security focuses on what happens to the information once the device is connected.</p>



<p>A company employee with updated security software can log‐on and upload sensitive information to their personal Dropbox account. It may be they’re legitimately working from home, or they might be sharing company secrets.</p>



<p>Network security’s challenge is <strong>deciding how and where the information can go</strong>, balancing the information flow with the need to get work done.</p>



<h3>3. Securing IoT devices</h3>



<p>IT analysts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2015-01-07-gartner-says-weak-mobile-customer-service-is-harming-customer-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner predict</a>&nbsp;the Internet of Things (IoT) will have 26 billion devices by the year 2020. That number excludes desktops, laptops and smartphones. Everything from cars, refrigerators, cash registers and hospital equipment can connect to the internet and therefore has the potential to be hijacked.</p>



<p>Everything in the IoT presents a risk.&nbsp;<a href="https://hdguru.com/concerned-your-tv-is-spying-on-you-turn-it-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart TVs actively collect data</a>&nbsp;about what programmes you watch and how long for. In the best case scenario this data can be used by networks to determine ratings and programme popularity. In the worst case, that information can be sold to third parties who can target you based on your personal interests and viewing habits.</p>



<p>If you want to protect your computer, you can buy and install antivirus and encryption software. How do you do the same for your smart energy meter?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29643276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hackers in Spain</a>&nbsp;have already compromised the IoT so their smart meter under‐reports their energy use. The big challenge for the IoT will be protecting these devices from unlawful and unwarranted access and securing your data.</p>

<p>Network monitoring is an essential expense for most businesses, but it’s important to research the different tools available so you don’t get ripped off. It&#8217;s also one of <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">the crucial areas in cyber security</a> you need to have in place. </p>



<p>As your business grows, you will need to invest in more sophisticated tools to protect your technology and prevent it from falling. One of the most important tools to consider is <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/iot-network-and-endpoint-security-challenges/">network monitoring software</a>, which scans&nbsp;for problems – from frozen servers to&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">security threats</a>&nbsp;and everything in between. </p>



<p>The monitoring itself is automated with software or tools, and as soon as a problem is detected the network administrator (either yourself or your IT partner, depending on the size of your business) is notified.  </p>



<p>The sooner you find out there is a problem, the sooner you can take steps to find an appropriate solution. If your business is very small, it’s probably relatively easy to keep track of everything yourself. But as soon as you hire staff and employ multiple devices across a network, there’s a risk of missing important  IT reports and warnings. </p>



<p>Network monitoring gives you peace of mind that if there’s a problem, you will be notified. However, the cost of using network monitoring tools can be high. As a  budget-conscious business owner, how do you protect your network without spending a fortune? </p>



<h2>How do you protect your network without spending a fortune?</h2>



<p>The first step is to find a way to measure the return on investment (ROI).  </p>



<p>If you already have a network monitoring system in place, figure out whether it is saving you money and adding value to your business. The best way to measure ROI is to calculate the ‘time saved’ thanks to your&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies/">network monitoring</a>&nbsp;software. </p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul><li>How long would it have taken to identify and fix the problems without the software?</li><li>How would have this impacted staff productivity through downtime and network outages?</li><li>And how many support calls would you have had to make?</li></ul>



<p>Conducting this simple ROI exercise can help you see the value in network monitoring software, but you should still shop around to make sure you are getting the best deal for your business. </p>



<p>Do your due diligence and collect quotes from various network monitoring suppliers so you can compare the pros and cons of each one. </p>



<p>At iT360, we can recommend the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-products/security-services/network-discovery?referral=it360" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WatchGuard Network Discovery</a>&nbsp;tool.  Not only is this an affordable option, but it also comes with a simple 1-click integration function, meaning it can easily connect to other WatchGuard products such as firewalls and traffic monitoring tools. </p>



<p>Network monitoring is an expense – but like many expenses, the cost of not employing a solution across your network could be much higher. Business leaders need to realise that cyber&nbsp;security is a big <strong>deal.&nbsp;It affects&nbsp;reputation, internal communication and even company culture.&nbsp;<a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">Download our free guide</a>&nbsp;to better understand</strong>.</p>

<p>Think you’re protected from <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> threats because you’ve got firewalls and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-signs-you-probably-need-new-antivirus-software-security/">antivirus software</a>? Think again. </p>



<p>You must secure your wireless network, too. <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">Staying safe in the digital age</a>&nbsp;is extremely challenging because there are so many ‘gaps’ or ‘windows’ that hackers can jump through. How to secure your wireless network &#8211; and&nbsp;protect yourself and your business – simply comes down to finding ways to seal all of these gaps  as efficiently as possible. </p>



<h2>Keeping hackers out is a like trying to keep a New Zealand home warm in winter</h2>



<p>Kiwi houses are notoriously difficult to heat due to a lack of  insulation, double-glazed windows, or adequate ventilation systems. If you live in a cold, damp house, the challenge is to identify all the  areas where heat is escaping and fix them accordingly. For example, you might need to take the following actions: </p>



<ul><li>install insulation in the ceiling, walls and beneath the floorboards;</li><li>seal any gaps in the framework, including around windows and under doors;</li><li>invest in a heating or ventilation system, such as HRV or a heat pump;</li><li>put up thermal-lined curtains to keep the warmth in at night; or</li><li>retrofit your home with double-glazed windows.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, doing one of these things isn’t enough in isolation. If you buy a heat pump but fail to seal your windows or install insulation without curtains, then the heat will simply escape through other gaps.  </p>



<p>While you may not be able to afford to do everything on the list, you should <strong>combine as many actions as you can</strong> for maximum energy efficiency. The same mentality can be applied to&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">cyber security</a>&nbsp;(although it’s important to keep in mind that the consequences of a hacked network tend to be more problematic than those of a cold house).  </p>



<p>Consequences aside, the point is – you need to take a collaborative approach to cyber security. <strong>There’s no ‘one-size-fits-all’ solution</strong>. Seal as many gaps as you can. </p>



<h2><strong>One gap that many businesses overlook is their wireless network</strong></h2>



<p>An unsecured wireless network is vulnerable to hackers, malware, and  other suspicious activity. </p>



<p>To quote&nbsp;WatchGuard,&nbsp;“Today’s network threats aren’t tethered to the desktop. Your security can’t be, either.” </p>



<p>According to WatchGuard’s director of product management, Ryan Orsi, wireless threats are becoming more frequent and problematic due to the availability of public wifi networks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Organisations across all industries are facing increased 
pressure from customers, vendors, and employees to offer wireless 
access. Unfortunately, hackers are also constantly trying to gain a 
foothold into the network,”</p></blockquote>



<p>Ryan Orsi goes on to&nbsp;recommend that all organisations implement improved security, in particular on wifi networks. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Businesses that fail to properly secure their wifi 
networks, including guest hotspots, may expose customers, partners, and 
internal users to a variety of risks.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Exposing such threats could be extremely damaging to your reputation as a  business and cause your customers to look elsewhere. When viewed in this light, wireless security is as much about protecting your reputation – and giving your customers peace of mind – as it is about protecting your security.</p>



<p>WatchGuard offers a number of products and features to secure <strong>your wifi networks, such as the WatchGuard Firebox T30 and T50, the WatchGuard Firebox T10, and WatchGuard Access Points.
