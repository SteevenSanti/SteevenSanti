<p>Have you ever imagined going through one day without internet?</p>



<p>From the moment you wake up until you go back to sleep, you don’t have an internet connection. You can’t check your email and social media accounts. You can’t chat with your colleagues. You can’t do a video conference with them. You can’t even access all your files and important documents because they are all stored in the cloud.</p>



<p>As a business owner, it’s almost impossible to go through one day without connecting to the internet. Apart from your email and social media accounts, you also have your work apps and tools that helps with efficiency and productivity.</p>



<p>For example, a retailer will have the POS software connected to the eCommerce site. If the POS can’t connect to the eCommerce site, a customer might order an item that is out of stock because someone already bought it in the store.</p>



<p>Or let’s say you want to log/track/manage your expenses, how can you do that when your data is in the cloud? How would you check if your bank has enough cash to pay off a vendor? How can you disburse payroll? All these are real-world scenarios and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">why cyber security is important for your business</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you might have already realized, the internet (or the ability to connect to it) is essential to modern businesses like yours.</p>



<h2>The Internet Makes Businesses More Efficient and Productive</h2>



<p>One of the ways the internet helps businesses be more efficient is the ability to store files in the cloud. With this, anyone on your team can access them whenever and wherever they are.</p>



<p>And as the modern workforce is becoming more mobile (and even global in some cases), businesses will continue relying on the internet (or software or tools or apps that connects to the internet).</p>



<p>This includes storing data (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive), collaborating with each other through a variety of apps/software (Google Docs, Trello, Asana), and communication software (Skype, MS Teams, Slack).</p>



<p>All these rely on the internet to work. It may still work while offline, but it will only have limited functionality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/coworking-space-1024x683.jpg" alt="coworking space" title="Mounting Security Complexity 1"></figure>



<h3>Hyperconnectivity Is Causing Problems for Businesses</h3>



<p>However, this hyperconnectivity has brought about a lot of problems. Before going through these problems, take a look at this brief history of businesses.</p>



<h3>Brief history of business</h3>



<p>As you may probably know, modern society has gone through three distinct eras or periods of time: agriculture, industrial, and knowledge.</p>



<p>Now is the age of knowledge — where what you know matters more than anything else. Knowledge has become the global currency of 21st century economies.</p>



<p>Knowledge workers (people whose output of work is based on what they know) are the 3rd wave of human socio-economic development.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker#cite_note-15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Savage</a>, most of the world’s population will be distributed by the type of work they do:</p>



<ul><li>2% of working population will work on land (agriculture)</li><li>10% will work in industry</li><li>Rest will be knowledge workers</li></ul>



<h3>Why and how this is important</h3>



<p>The glue that holds modern businesses is its <strong>ability to connect with each other </strong>and parts of the business through the internet. This has led to the modern workforce scattered across the country (or the world) and created an army of on-the-go entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>These “knowledge workers” often use the internet to get their work done. Just like the examples earlier, if you cannot connect to the internet, it’s almost impossible to get work done.</p>



<p>This makes the internet paramount to the productivity and success of modern businesses. But this has also created a wide range of problems.</p>



<p>Given that the internet is public — no one “owns” it — there’s a growing need for businesses and individuals alike to to protect your data and other sensitive information.</p>



<h2>Statistics and Reality of Cyber Crimes</h2>



<p>According to a report by HP, <a href="https://securitybrief.co.nz/story/almost-half-of-nz-businesses-unprepared-for-data-breaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly half of New Zealand Businesses aren’t prepared for a Cyber Attack</a>. If that doesn’t scare you, did you know that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">70% small and medium businesses have been targeted a cyber attack</a>?</p>



<p>&#8220;The consequences of a data breach are severe; from financial to brand and reputation damage,” says Grant Hopkins, managing director at HP New Zealand.</p>



<p>There are a lot of different kinds of cyber attacks. According to Hiscox, an insurance company, the most common cyber attacks are the following:</p>



<ol><li><strong>IP theft</strong> &#8212; robbing companies of their ideas and inventions</li><li><strong>Phishing</strong> &#8212; fraudulently pretending to be someone else</li><li><strong>Denial of service</strong> &#8212; flooding the target with traffic triggering a crash</li><li><strong>Ransomware</strong> &#8212; locking a computer system until a ransom is paid</li></ol>



<p>If you don’t think this affects you, take a look at this video where they replicated how a cyber attack would happen in real-life.</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1b8865GOHU" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure>



<h2>Top Two Problems When You Can’t Access Your Organization’s Data</h2>



<h3>Problem 1: Without the ability to access your data, your organization stops working</h3>



<p>If you and your employees can’t connect to the internet or access your data, your organization stops working.</p>



<p>Denial of service — one of the most common cybercrime. It can be as “simple” as not being able to access your website (i.e. they changed some files and redirected it to a page that says you’ve been hacked); or causing your web host (and therefore your website) to crash; or not being able to access any files from your servers (ransomware, where you need to pay a certain amount to get the decryption key).</p>



<h3>Problem 2: If organizational data gets breached/stolen, it can cost a huge amount of money and create animosity in the eyes of your customers</h3>



<p>Getting hacked or getting your data breached/leaked is one of the things that seems to keep resurfacing in the news every week.</p>



<p>Last January, one of the biggest Cryptocurrency wallet Cryptopia was hacked which led them to lose an estimated $2.5m to 3.5m. A few days later, the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Collection #1 breach</a> was leaked to the public.</p>



<p>It’s just a few weeks in 2019, these types of news won’t stop soon. With estimates that cyber attacks this year will only increase.</p>



<h3>Costs of Cyber Attacks You’re Probably Not Aware Of</h3>



<p>Two things happen when your business in involved in a data breach:</p>



<ol><li>You lose revenues</li><li>You spend more</li></ol>



<p>The first downside of getting breached is you lose the trust of your customers (and would-be customers). This leads to lost revenues for your business. Apart from that, you’d have to spend more to recover what was lost in terms of salaries and fees, not to mention the penalties you may pay.</p>



<p>Remember the Equifax Breach of 2017? After a few months, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-equifax-cyber-idUSKCN1GE257" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported that breach-related costs will reach $439M by the end of 2018</a>. And this still doesn’t involve money they lost from drops in their stocks, or lost of revenues from their customers.</p>



<p>According to the 2018 Cost of a Data Breach Study, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average cost for each lost or stolen record</a> containing sensitive and confidential information is $148. But with organizations storing thousands (or millions of data), that could add up quickly.</p>



<p>The other cost of a cyber attack is that you spend more to recover the data/information that were stolen. If you’re not prepared, this means hiring security experts that charge you a higher fee because of the urgency/emergency situation.</p>



<p>With lost revenues and added costs, that puts a big dent on your company’s profits. And if you’re a small business without deep pockets, a cyber attack might put you out of business.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/multi-factor-authroization-with-physical-key-1024x683.jpg" alt="multi factor authroization with physical key" title="Mounting Security Complexity 2"></figure>



<h2>Solution: Extra Vigilance and Continuous Education</h2>



<h3>1. Educate yourself and your organization in online security</h3>



<p>The only way to prevent and avoid getting hacked is to educate not only yourself, but also your employees.</p>



<p>First, as a business owner, you should <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">stop believing in these 15 myths about cyber security</a>. Next, don’t assume that your employees are aware and familiar with cyber security. Here are <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">21 cyber security tips</a> you and your employees can read to avoid getting hacked.</p>



<p>And that’s just the start.</p>



<p>Cyber criminals are becoming smarter. They can bypass any software and go undetected for long periods of time — allowing them time to inflict real damage to your business. According to the same IBM report, it takes an average of 197 days to detect/identify a data breach.</p>



<p>The longer the time it takes for an organization to identify and contain the breach, the higher the costs associated with it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“If the average time to identify a breach (MTTI) was under 100 days, the estimated average total cost of a data breach was $3.11 million. If it was over 100, the estimated cost was $4.21 million, representing $1.1 million additional cost.”</p><p>&#8211; 2018 Cost of a Data Breach Report</p></blockquote>



<p>The best way to avoid a data breach is to educate yourself and your organization about it. We came up with a free 4-day email bootcamp on passwords. You can click here to enroll (or ask your employees to enroll in them too).</p>



<h3>2. Implement a cyber security program/policy that covers prevention/cure (i.e. what to do to avoid getting hacked and what to do when you get hacked)</h3>



<p>As businesses rely more on the internet, it’s important that everyone in your company is aware of its risks — both personally and professionally.</p>



<p>Below are some steps you can do to ensure that your business will remain vigilant of cybercrime:</p>



<h4>Tip #1: Include cyber security as part of onboarding new employees</h4>



<p>Never assume that your employees — especially new ones — are aware of the risks of using the internet.</p>



<p>Remember that <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">47% company breaches are caused by employees</a>; and people have a contribution to 96% of all data breaches. So, make sure you educate your new employees on best practices and ways to avoid getting hacked.</p>



<h4>Tip #2: Frequent training / education for current employees</h4>



<p>One of the best way to ensure your employees don’t forget about the risks of using the internet, or retain their knowledge in cyber security, it’s best to include frequent reminders about the topic.</p>



<p>You can start with a simple company newsletter every month, then some sort of quiz, or a company webinar that you can conduct live then store it in a company site for employees to watch later on.</p>



<p>Here are some topics you can cover:</p>



<ul><li>Common scams/phishing methods</li><li>New developments</li><li>Protection of personal devices (esp. at home)</li></ul>



<p>An example of this <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff/">continuous education</a> is the email series on passwords. We’re coming up with more topics like those in the future. If you want to receive or more information about that, just let us know here.</p>



<p>One important reminder as you think of topics and content for your organization is to make sure the individual can relate to it.</p>



<p>Instead of just talking about potentially losing millions of $, you can talk about losing their entire savings account; or in the case of privacy concerns, their private photos or messages can be leaked.</p>

<p>So you run a virus scan of your computer every now and again? While that might be fine for your home computer, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">your business and your customers deserve more security</a>.</p>



<p>Technology is improving all the time to monitor and fix&nbsp;threats before they can damage your network. Here are our top four your business can’t ignore.</p>



<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Online Security Protection for New Zealand businesses? <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/go/online-security-for-nz-businesses/ebook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" label=" (opens in a new tab)">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE!</a></strong></p>



<h2>4 Emerging Technologies You Should Be Using</h2>



<h3>1. Hardware Authentication</h3>



<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach/">Usernames and passwords are less than secure</a>. Most of us use the same ones for a number of accounts. Or we use something that’s easy to remember, and therefore easy to guess. Even worse, we have sticky labels with login details around our screens or written down on a piece of cardboard in your wallet. We need a more secure way to authenticate who we are online.</p>



<p>Intel is working on a new processor to combat this problem. It’s looking to include a user’s identity and authentication within the computer’s hardware. With a computer chipset, your device becomes the key and proves it should have access to a particular network. It restricts access and majorly beefs up your business’ security.</p>



<h3>2. User-Behaviour Analytics (UBA)</h3>



<p>If someone gets your login details they will try to <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/6-it-virus-and-cyber-security-threats/">steal your identity</a>. </p>



<p>Most security focuses on stopping people from getting in. What if the network could tell that someone with your username and password wasn’t you and let you know? This would close a serious gap in defense.</p>



<p>UBA technology can compare your past, legitimate behaviour with what’s currently happening on your account. It can also compare odd activity with others in your company in a similar role. User-behaviour analytics can raise a red flag that someone is doing something with their account that they shouldn’t, or that someone has their access details.</p>



<h3>3. Deep Learning</h3>



<p>Not quite artificial intelligence, but this emerging technology gets close. Instead of analysing user behaviour, the Deep Learning system looks at “entities” from the micro to the macro level to see where legitimate or acceptable behaviour turns malicious.</p>



<p>These machines will be able to determine what’s good or bad software from what it’s trying to do, and will be able to remove advanced threats, viruses and <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">malware</a> as soon as they appear, seriously improving cyber security.</p>



<h3>4. The Cloud</h3>



<p>An online storage system most of us use every day. For many organisations it’s <strong>replacing the need for on-site servers</strong>, but there are still major differences between cloud providers.</p>



<p>As more businesses make the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement/">transition to the cloud</a>, providers will need to build on-site security techniques like firewalls, intrusion and detection devices into their platform, making the infrastructure safer and more secure.</p>



<p>A large cloud provider will almost certainly be able to do more cyber security on a larger scale to protect their clients than what most small businesses can achieve on their own.</p>



<p>If your business IT can know when someone with your login details isn’t you, will only allow access from certain devices or receives extra layers of security from a vigilant cloud service provider, your business will be much better protected. You just can’t afford to ignore this emerging technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The employment marketplace is getting more competitive. Many companies are looking for someone 24 – 29 years old with 30+ years of experience so they can add the most value to their company with minimal risk.</p>



<p>How can you <em>realistically</em> identify which employees are your biggest security risk? Aruba Networks surveyed over 11,500 employees across 23 countries to find out. And as the saying goes, the numbers don’t lie.</p>



<h2>5 Statistics You Can&#8217;t Ignore Who Are Your Company&#8217;s Biggest&nbsp;Security Risk</h2>



<h3>1. The Weaker Sex</h3>



<p>Males are more likely to lose data than females. Men are 20% more likely to misuse a smartphone and lose personal or client data and 40% less likely than females to fall victim to identity theft.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/risks-of-using-wireless-technology-in-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How employee use of mobile technology puts your network security at risk</a></p>



<h3>2. The Young Ones</h3>



<p>Those aged between 25 – 34 years old are twice as likely to become identity theft victims or lose client data than someone over 55.</p>



<h3>3. More Money = More Problems</h3>



<p>Surprisingly, those on higher incomes posed greater risk. Employees on $18K or less per year are half as likely to lose sensitive company data than those earning $60K.</p>



<p>Ironically, those earning over<strong> $75k were three times more likely</strong> to give out their password if offered money than employees making less than $18K.</p>



<h3>4. Risky Business</h3>



<p>Scarily, the <strong>finance industry has serious problems</strong>.</p>



<p>2 out of 5 people surveyed who work in financial institutions admitted to losing company data through mobile mismanagement. That’s 25% higher than the average across all industries surveyed.</p>



<h3>5. Better Education Needed</h3>



<p>Nearly a third of education sector workers store passwords, login details and other sensitive data on a sheet of paper. Of all industries surveyed, <strong>those working in education are least likely to password protect personal&nbsp;smartphones</strong>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>What conclusions can we draw from this? Saying you want to hire women over 35 years old and pay them less to reduce your company’s IT risks is likely to have the opposite effect. That’s not a good risk management strategy!</p>



<h3>Know and Understand</h3>



<p>Show employees why you have security measures in place and how to use them. Also, teach employees about how their online behaviour can impact on your business, and the consequences of data breaches.</p>



<p>For the self-obsessing younger generation more likely to engage in risky behaviour, they need to see how downloading an app from outside official app stores or opening emails from unknown senders will impact them as a part of your business.</p>



<p>If you want to learn more about how to protect yourself online, you can enroll in our free <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> email series.

<h3>Set Security Rules</h3>



<p>Employee IT security policy should be well set out so everyone knows what’s expected of them. In some cases, these rules can be enforced with usage restrictions or two­stage authentication to prevent employees from becoming lazy or careless with regards IT.</p>



<h3>Keep It Up</h3>



<p>Do you know how much technology is released in a year? The world of IT is constantly updating, so refreshing your employees once a year on good practice and their IT responsibilities isn’t going to cut it.</p>



<p>Scheduling quarterly meetings, or something more regular to update your system and remind employees of the importance of IT security will protect your business by reducing risky behaviour.</p>

<p>As systems evolve, security must evolve with it. Gone are the times when one computer would connect to one server or network. Now multiple devices want access to multiple networks all hours of the day and night. <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">The linear line of security has morphed into a spider’s web of connectivity</a>.</p>



<p>What are the greatest challenges businesses face in this new information era, and how can you combat them?</p>



<h2>What Is Endpoint Security?</h2>



<p>Endpoint security is a network protection strategy (one of the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">crucial areas in cyber security</a> you need to protect in your business) that grants access to devices like desktops, laptops, tablets or phones that meet certain credentials. It takes needing a username and password one step further, so only approved, safe devices have access.</p>



<p>People use a mix of personal and company devices to get work done, and each has varying levels of security. Endpoint security’s main goal is to <strong>prevent a device without anti-virus software, an approved operating system or virtual private network (VPN) from logging on to your company network.</strong></p>



<h2>Top 3 Challenges in Endpoint Security</h2>



<h3>1. Keeping all devices up-to-date</h3>



<p>The challenge is keeping all devices up-to-date with your business’ <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/no-cyber-security-policy/">security policy</a> so everyone who needs access can have it and get work done. If it’s too strict, or people get lax on updates productivity will plummet as people become unable to log on and have access to the information they need to do their job.</p>



<h3>2. Ensure information is used correctly</h3>



<p>The amount of information flowing across networks is increasing daily. One of the biggest challenges to network security is <strong>protecting that information and make sure it’s being used correctly.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike endpoint security which focuses on preventing some devices from logging on, network security focuses on what happens to the information once the device is connected.</p>



<p>A company employee with updated security software can log‐on and upload sensitive information to their personal Dropbox account. It may be they’re legitimately working from home, or they might be sharing company secrets.</p>



<p>Network security’s challenge is <strong>deciding how and where the information can go</strong>, balancing the information flow with the need to get work done.</p>



<h3>3. Securing IoT devices</h3>



<p>IT analysts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2015-01-07-gartner-says-weak-mobile-customer-service-is-harming-customer-engagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gartner predict</a>&nbsp;the Internet of Things (IoT) will have 26 billion devices by the year 2020. That number excludes desktops, laptops and smartphones. Everything from cars, refrigerators, cash registers and hospital equipment can connect to the internet and therefore has the potential to be hijacked.</p>



<p>Everything in the IoT presents a risk.&nbsp;<a href="https://hdguru.com/concerned-your-tv-is-spying-on-you-turn-it-off/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart TVs actively collect data</a>&nbsp;about what programmes you watch and how long for. In the best case scenario this data can be used by networks to determine ratings and programme popularity. In the worst case, that information can be sold to third parties who can target you based on your personal interests and viewing habits.</p>



<p>If you want to protect your computer, you can buy and install antivirus and encryption software. How do you do the same for your smart energy meter?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29643276" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hackers in Spain</a>&nbsp;have already compromised the IoT so their smart meter under‐reports their energy use. The big challenge for the IoT will be protecting these devices from unlawful and unwarranted access and securing your data.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things is emerging all around us. This machine-­to-­machine communication is no longer a plotline from The Jetsons but one built on cloud technology and a network of data-gathering sensors.</p>



<p>From our TV, fridge, car and electricity meter, more technology is connecting online. The IoT allows multiple objects to communicate instantly and gather data, essentially giving the machine a brain that holds information and uses it efficiently to fulfil a function.</p>



<p>For example, some Australian tollbooths are now cashless and unmanned. A sensor in your car communicates with the tollbooth, calculates your fare, subtracts the sum from a nominated account and emails you a receipt.</p>



<p>Another example of IoT is the rise of the Fitbit. A watch that measuring heartbeats and movement to calculate how many steps you have taken, and sends your progress to your smartphone and an online account. The IoT can allow your watch to communicate with other devices making it easy to track your fitness and compare activity levels over time.</p>



<p>The rise of this “Smart” technology, with the potential to send an infinite amount of data brings its own very real <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">online security risks</a>.</p>



<p>The Internet of Things essentially functions on it’s own. Harmless in Fitbits, and making life easier by speeding up traffic through toll roads. Collecting personal information licence plates and locations without the driver’s consent seems trivial until we consider the possibility of this technology being manipulated by those with the power, knowledge and access to do so. It poses the potential, as with all cloud networks containing data, the ability to be hacked.</p>



<p>It’s predicted a quarter of a billion vehicles will be connected to the internet by 2020, which is great for providing Wi­Fi hotspots, connecting SatNavs and entertainment features. It also allows people anywhere in the world to find your car’s IP address,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remotely hack your car</a>&nbsp;and take complete control.</p>



<p>As hackers track your car’s GPS, they could shut you down and lock the doors in a remote location, only returning control when money is wired to their account.</p>



<p>The Internet of Things brings many benefits and drawbacks. It increases the efficiency of some machines, minimises human error and has the potential to save lives! The parking sensors on some cars communicate with the brakes and will automatically if a driver gets too close to a stationary object. Like anything connected to the internet, we must consider the potential for this delicate and data­sensitive system to be manipulated, and put extra security in place. We may not live in a world with flying cars and robots that make us breakfast, but even The Jetsons would be impressed by the capabilities of the Internet of Things.</p>



<p>So what does this mean for the business world? Basically more security risks, as outlined in this&nbsp;<a href="https://idealog.co.nz/tech/2016/04/internet-things-go-bleep-night" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Idealog article</a>.</p>



<p>“A few years ago I heard an IBM presentation describing a near future where we wouldn’t need keys, swipe cards, passwords and so forth. Everything; our house, our car, workplace, computer systems, POS terminals and the like, would know who we are and simply make available everything we had access permissions for. I love the idea in theory, but a rather horrifying thought occurred to me even then; wouldn’t that mean it was possible just to ‘switch someone off’, revoking their access to everything?”</p>



<p>And for now we will leave you there, pondering the future possibilities of this technology.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">80% of computer problems</a> are caused by human error.</p>



<p>Think about that for a second. You can have the best computers, the most powerful anti‐virus programme known to man, every type of security system possible to protect your data and devices and people will still manage to find a way around them.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why you&#8217;d often hear about the <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">3 pillars of cyber security</a> where one of them is always people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>‘Computer’ means more than your PC and laptop.</p>



<p>Your tablet and smartphone are mobile computers that can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/which-employees-are-your-biggest-security-risk/">increase the productivity and risks</a> of most businesses.</p>



<p>Most of the time such breaches will be accidental and not malicious in nature, but that doesn’t make the resulting problem any less damaging for your company.</p>



<p>All organisations face different challenges. Regardless of team size or industry, sometimes the biggest challenge in a business can be getting everyone in a room to for a 30‐minute talk. Research has shown that over all the programmes, systems and software you can install, <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">educating your employees about online security and mobile risk</a> is the best way to protect your business.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/risks-of-using-wireless-technology-in-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How employees use of mobile technology puts your network security at risk</a></p>



<h2>3 Steps to Develop Online Security Awareness in Your Organisation</h2>



<h3>Step 1: Create and Engage</h3>



<p>The first step is to have a <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/no-cyber-security-policy/">basic security and information policy</a>. It can be included in employment contracts or employee handbooks, but is best discussed in person. Your policy should cover which devices each employee has access to and what they can be used for. Use the time to educate your team on how they can protect the company and why their actions are important.</p>



<p>Younger generations often feel like their online actions are anonymous and have no real repercussions. It’s hard to measure personal impact if the consequences happen in another part of the city, country or world. Overcoming this mind set is essential for building a mobile aware culture.</p>



<h3>Step 2: Measure and Monitor</h3>



<p>The next step is using firewalls, mobile device management (MDM) or policy engines to measure, monitor and enforce these policies. It’s important that employees can still do their jobs without the added security impacting their usability or productivity. These programmes will also allow you to see if anyone is trying to access files, sites, or share information they shouldn’t. This gives you a chance to chat with that person one‐on‐one and ensure they fully understand the policy.</p>



<h3>Step 3: Feedback and Adjust</h3>



<p>Just as social media allows two‐way conversation with businesses and clients, your <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-create-an-it-policy/">IT security policy</a> should also allow for employee feedback and requests. There’s no benefit in having mobile aware staff if the security policy prevents them from doing their job properly. Policies and programmes can be changed to suit different requirements, so make sure there are opportunities for your team to have input.</p>



<p>51% of employees across 23 countries surveyed by Aruba Networks said <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/using-it-to-mobilise-and-manage-your-workforce/">mobile technologies</a> enable them to be more productive and engaged. There’s no way of avoiding it! In this day and age if a business tried doing away with cell phones, tablets and laptops it wouldn’t take long to be left behind by their competition.</p>



<p>Given the always‐on, mobile office is here to stay, your best move for developing a mobile aware culture is working with changes. Take an adaptive policy approach to connectivity and data security that educates and encourages your employees while protecting your business.</p>
