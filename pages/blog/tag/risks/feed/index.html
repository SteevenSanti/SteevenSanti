										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The employment marketplace is getting more competitive. Many companies are looking for someone 24 – 29 years old with 30+ years of experience so they can add the most value to their company with minimal risk.</p>



<p>How can you <em>realistically</em> identify which employees are your biggest security risk? Aruba Networks surveyed over 11,500 employees across 23 countries to find out. And as the saying goes, the numbers don’t lie.</p>



<h2>5 Statistics You Can&#8217;t Ignore Who Are Your Company&#8217;s Biggest&nbsp;Security Risk</h2>



<h3>1. The Weaker Sex</h3>



<p>Males are more likely to lose data than females. Men are 20% more likely to misuse a smartphone and lose personal or client data and 40% less likely than females to fall victim to identity theft.</p>



<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/risks-of-using-wireless-technology-in-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How employee use of mobile technology puts your network security at risk</a></p>



<h3>2. The Young Ones</h3>



<p>Those aged between 25 – 34 years old are twice as likely to become identity theft victims or lose client data than someone over 55.</p>



<h3>3. More Money = More Problems</h3>



<p>Surprisingly, those on higher incomes posed greater risk. Employees on $18K or less per year are half as likely to lose sensitive company data than those earning $60K.</p>



<p>Ironically, those earning over<strong> $75k were three times more likely</strong> to give out their password if offered money than employees making less than $18K.</p>



<h3>4. Risky Business</h3>



<p>Scarily, the <strong>finance industry has serious problems</strong>.</p>



<p>2 out of 5 people surveyed who work in financial institutions admitted to losing company data through mobile mismanagement. That’s 25% higher than the average across all industries surveyed.</p>



<h3>5. Better Education Needed</h3>



<p>Nearly a third of education sector workers store passwords, login details and other sensitive data on a sheet of paper. Of all industries surveyed, <strong>those working in education are least likely to password protect personal&nbsp;smartphones</strong>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>What conclusions can we draw from this? Saying you want to hire women over 35 years old and pay them less to reduce your company’s IT risks is likely to have the opposite effect. That’s not a good risk management strategy!</p>



<h3>Know and Understand</h3>



<p>Show employees why you have security measures in place and how to use them. Also, teach employees about how their online behaviour can impact on your business, and the consequences of data breaches.</p>



<p>For the self-obsessing younger generation more likely to engage in risky behaviour, they need to see how downloading an app from outside official app stores or opening emails from unknown senders will impact them as a part of your business.</p>

<h3>Set Security Rules</h3>



<p>Employee IT security policy should be well set out so everyone knows what’s expected of them. In some cases, these rules can be enforced with usage restrictions or two­stage authentication to prevent employees from becoming lazy or careless with regards IT.</p>



<h3>Keep It Up</h3>



<p>Do you know how much technology is released in a year? The world of IT is constantly updating, so refreshing your employees once a year on good practice and their IT responsibilities isn’t going to cut it.</p>



<p>Scheduling quarterly meetings, or something more regular to update your system and remind employees of the importance of IT security will protect your business by reducing risky behaviour.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a workplace <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">cyber security</a> policy in place, highly sensitive commercial information could be <strong>unknowingly leaked</strong> by your employees. Would you put your business in the hands of your most junior staff  member? </p>



<p>The answer to this question is probably no – unless you have a  truly exceptional junior employee, in which case they probably deserve a  promotion! It may surprise you to hear that if you don’t have a workplace <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/how-to-create-an-it-policy/">cyber security policy</a> in place, you might as well be relinquishing control over sensitive company data to your employees. </p>



<p>One wrong click on a malicious website by an unsuspecting staff member and your entire organisation could be vulnerable to hackers and other cyber security breaches. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A workplace cyber security policy exists to educate and 
inform employees about cyber security best practices, so they are less 
likely to make critical errors or use company technology in an 
unprofessional manner.</p></blockquote>



<p> While a cyber security policy does not guarantee cyber safety, it does provide your employees with a set of rules surrounding workplace technology. It’s a way to prevent misuse and cultivate a positive&nbsp;cyber security culture within your organisation. If you’re yet to implement such a policy, don’t delay; the longer you go without, the higher the risk that one of your staff members will inadvertently (or worse, advertently) misuse company technology. Don&#8217;t let these <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind/">15 cyber security myths</a> hurt your business. </p>



<h2>3 Risks of Not Having a Cyber Security Policy</h2>



<p>
These are just some of the problems not having a policy can cause:
</p>



<h3>1. Leaked information</h3>



<p>What if your competitors got hold of important company information? For example about your rates, your client list, or your five-year plan? Without a policy, competitors could access your information through anything from a lost USB to a former employee. </p>



<p>A policy will outline steps to minimise the risk of this happening. </p>



<h3>2. Malware</h3>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-terms/">virus</a>&nbsp;can wreak havoc on your business systems and may even cause you to permanently lose important company data, especially if you haven’t backed it up (take this as a reminder to always <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1/">back up your data</a>).  Employees who do not understand cyber security may be <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things/">more likely to click on malicious links</a>. </p>



<h3>3. Phishing</h3>



<p>A phishing scam is when a hacker sends an email posing as an authoritative organisation, such as a bank or insurance company, and requests private details such as passwords, bank account numbers, or other sensitive information. If your staff are not aware of phishing scams, they may provide this information and therefore put your business at risk. </p>



<p>You can learn more about how you and your employees can <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">protect yourselves online here</a>. </p>



<p>Most employees don’t mean to cause harm. Often they do so by accident,  as a result of a lack of education or understanding. </p>



<p>A cyber security policy is your chance to provide this education and awareness, so they know exactly what risks to be aware of and how their actions impact the organisation’s cyber security protection as a whole. </p>

<p>Antivirus software will only get you so far; it must be accompanied by a  detailed policy outlining cyber security best practice. It’s not enough to trust that your employees “just know what to do”; the only way to protect your organisation is to create a clear policy and hold your staff members accountable to it, so there’s no room for misinterpretation. </p>



<p>Business leaders need to realise that cyber&nbsp;security is a big <strong>deal.&nbsp;It affects&nbsp;reputation, internal communication and even company  culture.&nbsp;Keen to understand more about Cyber Security in the Workplace? <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/cyber-security-workplace/">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE</a>!</strong></p>
