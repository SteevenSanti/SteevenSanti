<p>When you use <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_08.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Porter’s Five Forces</a> — a framework for analyzing a company, market, or industry — you’ll realize that the market is more saturated than ever with tons of alternatives/ substitutes, and changing buyer’s behaviors. </p>



<p>It is, therefore, imperative that businesses today <strong>strive to develop an unfair advantage</strong> in their industry or market in order to become successful. </p>



<h2>3 Challenges Every New Zealand Business Must Overcome</h2>



<h3>Challenge 1: More Competition</h3>



<p>A quick-and-dirty analysis using Porter’s 5 Forces reveals that almost every industry are in
the same situation. But before that, here’s a quick recap on the five forces:
</p>



<ol><li> <strong>Competitive rivalry</strong> — looks at the number and strength of your competitors. When rivalry is intense, companies often attract customers using price cuts. But when there’s minimal (or no) competition, the stronger your position is with healthy profits. </li><li> <strong><g class="gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="21" data-gr-id="21">Threat</g> of new entrants</strong> — refers to the ability of other people to enter your market. If it takes little money and effort to enter your market, or if others can replicate the technology you’re using, then rivals can quickly enter your market and weaken your position. </li><li> <strong><g class="gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="12" data-gr-id="12">Threat</g> of substitutes</strong> — the likelihood of your customers finding a different way of doing what you offer. If what you do can be replaced by something else available in the market, what’s stopping your customers from doing so? </li><li><strong>Bargaining power of buyers</strong> — how many buyers do you have and how big are their orders? How much would it cost them to switch to your competitors? When you deal with a few buyers, they have more power to dictate terms to you. </li><li> <strong>Bargaining power of sellers</strong> — how easy is it for your suppliers to increase their prices; how many suppliers do you have? The fewer suppliers there are, the more you need their help and the stronger their position and their ability to charge you more. </li></ol>



<p>This framework is often used to determine an industry’s attractiveness or assess the company in terms of its environment. </p>



<p>Take, for example, a fictional web development company called Best Web Agency. If you look at the competitors within the segment, there are a lot of them. There are <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="5" data-gr-id="5">indi- vidual</g> freelancers, companies <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">and</g> agencies doing website development services. </p>



<p>The barriers to entry in this industry are also individual. Anyone with design and programming experience can start offering these kinds of services. </p>



<p>In addition, there are a lot of drag-and-drop website builders that can act as an alternative
to the services Best Web Agency can offer. There are countless pre-built templates regard-
less of which platform the user chooses. All these factors make it difficult to stand out in
this market.
</p>



<h3>Challenge 2: People’s Buying Behavior Has Changed </h3>



<p>The internet has also changed the way people buy — both online and offline. It decentralized the buying process in that businesses can no longer withhold information that may prove useful in the buying cycle without it affecting them negatively later on. </p>



<p>For example, before the internet, buying a laptop means going to a store, talking to sales
people, and deciding on which model to purchase.
</p>



<p>Salespeople can opt not to share some important pieces of information like battery life or
power consumption, which may make some buyers hesitate. But with the internet, con-
sumers no longer <em>need </em>to ask and get these information from salespeople. They just search
for reviews online and make their decisions long before talking to someone from your com-
pany.
</p>



<h3>Challenge 3: Looming Online Threat
</h3>



<p>In addition, there is a continued rise of a new kind of threat — cyber attacks. With more and
more people relying on using the internet for their daily needs, it’s imperative that you equip
not only yourself with the knowledge and tools but also your staff.
</p>



<p>More than <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips/">84% of cyber security breaches</a> were caused by human error. This means that even if you are careful yourself, your staff might not have the same level of awareness. </p>



<p>In addition, about 70% of all SMBs have been targeted by a cyber attack in 2018. Unfortunately, most of them didn’t realize and weren’t prepared for these attacks. </p>



<p>These three challenges have to be faced by New Zealand business owners like you if you want to remain competitive, relevant, and successful. You must strive to develop an unfair advantage in your own industry. </p>
