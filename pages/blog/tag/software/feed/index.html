<p>Is your business still running on Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2? Or maybe even Windows SQL 2008? If you are, you’re putting your business and your data at great risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you probably already know, using outdated software has a lot of risks associated with it. While the mantra of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” sounds reasonable, that only works if nothing is really broken. But in this case, Microsoft is officially ending its support for the software.&nbsp;</p>



<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7fr2CtmaVmI" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe>



<h2>What End of Support Means for Your Business</h2>



<p>If you’re still using these operating systems on your servers, it’s imperative that you remember these important dates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On&nbsp;<strong>January 14, 2020</strong>, Microsoft will end their support for both Windows Server 2008 and R2. And if you’re still using Window SQL 2008, Microsoft already ended their support last&nbsp;<strong>July 2019</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>End of Support (EOS) often means that the technology has lived its useful life. That means new, better, and often less expensive technology is available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today’s world, using outdated technology means you can’t quickly adapt to changes in the market nor serve our customers exceptionally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is important because without support from Microsoft, that means you won’t be receiving any security updates from them. And that puts your entire business at risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Problem or Opportunity</h3>



<p>You can take a look at this end of support from two different perspectives and why you should use this time to modernise your business and migrate to Azure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, it’s a way for you to avoid security breaches and compliance issues in the future. It’s also a way to lower your costs as maintaining these old/legacy technologies is going to be more expensive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As their name implies, these operating systems came out in 2008. As you already know, 10 years (or more) is a very long time in the technology world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just take a look at how often big tech consumer brands introduce new products. Every single year, these brands hold events and unveil the latest technological developments they have made in the past year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung — all of them made introducing new products and services yearly that it has become a widely anticipated event.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>2008 Was Over a Decade Ago</h3>



<p>To give you an idea of how far along we’ve come, below are some of the most&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/12/top-technology-breakthroughs-of-2008/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-known technological breakthroughs in 2008</a>:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>USB 3.0</li><li>Apple’s App Store</li><li>Android</li><li>Flash memory/flash drives</li><li>GPS on mobile devices</li></ol>



<p>Today, these technologies are the standard or have already been replaced by newer versions (like USB 4.0).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in 2008, on-premise and upfront licensing costs were still the norm. If you want to get a server, you’d have to pay for it upfront. If you want to buy a&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/microsoft-365/">Microsoft Office</a>&nbsp;license for your computers, you’d have to buy the licenses upfront.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/services/cloud-solutions/">cloud</a>&nbsp;and pay-as-you-use models are more prevalent. Most options provide you a monthly payment scheme that scales up or down depending on your usage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Future Proof Your Business</h3>



<p>Another way to look at this is to use this event to propel your organisation into the future. By&nbsp;<a href="https://it360.co.nz/futureproof/">updating the technology</a>&nbsp;you use in your business, you’re keeping up with the times and joining the digital transformation revolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital transformation means&nbsp;<strong>relying less&nbsp;</strong>on on-premise, user-owned devices to a cloud-based one. This allows you to save up on costs and helps you with scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What Are My Options As a Business</h2>



<p>With the end of support coming soon, your business really has three options:</p>



<ol><li>100% cloud migration</li><li>Hybrid configuration&nbsp;</li><li>Status quo</li></ol>



<p>If you don’t know which option you should take, we’ll help you determine the best one for your specific situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From our experience, most businesses will benefit greatly from option 1. Some will be best suited for option 2. However, doing nothing (option 3) especially with the end of support coming soon is definitely is not an option you can choose.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Over to you</h2>



<p>IT is no longer a cost centre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In modern and successful businesses in New Zealand and all around the world, IT is treated as a business partner, as an enabler of the workforce. It’s one of the critical departments you need in order to create a strong competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are still using Windows Server 2008/R8, or even if you don’t know what you’re using but want to transform your business, let us know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can <a href="tel:09 916 1180">call us directly</a> or fill out the form below and someone from our team will reach out to you.&nbsp;</p>



<script async="" data-uid="a64123eca9" src="https://it360-limited.ck.page/a64123eca9/index.js"></script>



<p>Even if you don’t know what option is the best one to take for your business, we’ll help you figure it out. The important part is you take a step towards protecting your business and securing your future.</p>

<p><a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online/">Protecting yourself on the internet</a> is important now more than ever. With just a few weeks in 2019, there are already dozens of news on different kinds of cyber crimes — from data breaches, ransomware, theft, and many more. And don’t expect these things to stop anytime soon.</p>



<p>As we rely more on the internet on a daily basis, it’s paramount that we know how to protect ourselves from people who are looking to exploit others.</p>



<p>If you care about protecting your privacy and other sensitive information, this article is for you.</p>



<h2>Relying on Technology Alone Isn’t Enough to Protect You Online</h2>



<p>First thing’s first, let’s define what technology means.</p>



<p>To keep things simple, technology means both hardware (physical products) and software.</p>



<p>Remember, no piece of technology will be 100% perfect. All of these are made by humans that’s why they cannot be without fault.</p>



<h3>Example 1: When Hardware Fails</h3>



<p>Home and business routers get slammed on a regular basis for exploits that get discovered. Because routers are not patched (or even secure, they keep the default username and password of Admin / Admin), they are vulnerable to hacks. Home routers more than business routers, but both if they are not constantly patched and checked.</p>



<p>Below is a screenshot from one of our engineer’s home network. Take note that he does have his own business-grade firewall at home which is more secure. It also gives reports on what’s happening behind the scenes (i.e. someone trying to hack your router).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/home-router-exploit-1024x318.png" alt="home router exploits" title="Protect Yourself Online by Focusing on These Two Things 1"></figure>



<p>As you can see in the highlighted example, port 7547 was tried over 137 times which is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/mirai-evolving-new-attack-reveals-use-of-port-7547/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this exploit</a>.</p>



<p>You will also notice other ports that were tried within a time span of 4 minutes.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The sad part to this is that my ISP (which normally provides your home or default business router) doesn’t assist me in preventing any of these attacks. Even reporting back to them and giving them my logs, nothing is done. They do not feature in the security side of it all, so if you as the home or business owner don’t secure yourself &#8211; no one will.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><cite><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-van-zyl-97855947/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pieter van Zyl</a></cite></blockquote>



<h3>Example 2: When Software Fails</h3>



<p>A common example where software fails us is on email. Just take a look at your junk/spam folder. Our email provider’s spam filters catch most of these emails, but sometimes some come through our inboxes.</p>



<p>And if you aren’t aware of these phishing scams, you might accidentally install some malware on your computer, or fill-out a form with your information (like username/password).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/apple-id-phishing-email-1024x758.png" alt="apple id email phishing" title="Protect Yourself Online by Focusing on These Two Things 2"></figure>



<h2>You’re the Last Line of Defense</h2>



<p>When technology fails to protect us, the last line of defence against cyber criminals is yourself.</p>



<p>Remember the saying, “if there’s a will, there’s a way”? What that means is these cyber criminals are constantly trying to find ways to navigate around known security protocols to get your information and private data.</p>



<p>If you see an email in your inbox like the one above, what would you do?</p>



<p>Would you panic, click on the link, and enter your credentials? Or would you simply ignore it and mark the email as spam/junk?</p>



<h3>When Ignorance Isn’t Bliss</h3>



<p>We’re a huge advocate of multi-factor authentication (MFA). Basically, after entering your password, you get asked for a code to enter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://it360.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/MFA-in-action-1024x491.png" alt="MFA in action" title="Protect Yourself Online by Focusing on These Two Things 3"></figure>



<p>The example above uses an app to generate the code required in the right-hand image. There’s another type where an SMS is sent to your mobile number and that’s what you use instead.</p>



<p>But, did you know that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-tool-automates-phishing-attacks-that-bypass-2fa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two-factor authentication (2FA) via SMS is not as secure</a> as you think?</p>



<p>Polish researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/drk1wi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piotr Duszyński</a> just published a program <a href="https://github.com/drk1wi/Modlishka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">named Modlishka on GitHub</a> where a hacker can potentially gain access to your account despite having 2FA enabled?</p>



<p>When asked why the programmer made the program public, his answer might surprise you.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;We have to face the fact that without a working proof of concept, that really proves the point, the risk is treated as theoretical, and no real measures are taken to address it properly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This status quo, and lack of awareness about the risk, is a perfect situation for malicious actors that will happily exploit it.&#8221;</p><cite>Piotr Duszyński</cite></blockquote>



<h3>Awareness and Continuous Education Is the Answer</h3>



<p>In cases where technology fails us, you’re the only one who can prevent your data and other sensitive information from getting stolen.</p>



<p>Read up on <a href="https://it360.co.nz/blog/mounting-security-complexity/">common cyber security threats</a> that you may face in your daily lives. Here’s a list of the most common ones:</p>



<ol><li><strong>IP theft</strong>&nbsp;— when individuals/organizations steal your ideas then launch products/services before you do</li><li><strong>Phishing</strong>&nbsp;— this is where you receive an email that asks you to go to a link, download and install something, or fill-up a form. Also, remember that this isn’t limited to email. It can happen via SMS, a tweet, or any communication channel.</li><li><strong>Denial of service</strong>&nbsp;— where you can&#8217;t access your website/server</li><li><strong>Ransomware</strong>&nbsp;— locking a computer system until a ransom is paid</li></ol>



<p>Or the easiest way to stay updated on these things is to enrol in our special email series where we discuss these topics and how you can protect yourself online.</p>



<p>The first one we released is on the topic of passwords. If you want to learn more about <a href="https://info.it360.co.nz/lp/anti-password-nirvana/">using passwords in all your accounts</a> — email, social media, work and productivity apps — to avoid getting hacked, just head on over here.</p>
