This enabled Spark business customers in those areas to access IT services and to tie that into their existing Spark relationship and billing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, the opportunity arose to work with Spark further afield, in the Taranaki region.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iT360 CEO Dave Wilson reached out to a long-time friend, Taranaki local and IT industry veteran James Robinson, to lead the new business, which has now opened and is serving customers both through the Spark partnership and directly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that certainly has iT360 eyeing other regions, for the moment the company is focused on creating an operation in Taranaki that is as &#8220;successful and sustainable&#8221; as that in Auckland, Robinson said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A family-owned business, IT360 said every part of the business is championed by individuals whose focus is to deliver a &#8220;fantastic&#8221; customer experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinson was excited to introduce new Taranaki customers to the team and enable them to experience what he described as the \u201cwhite-glove\u201d customer onboarding process led by customer service manager Chris Jordan. In accounts, director Ruth Wilson also happens to head up pastoral care of employees and even of customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our ideal customers are those for whom this approach to business really matters,&#8221; Robinson said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iT360 said it backed this people-centric approach with technical expertise and a &#8220;strong strategic game&#8221;.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Technical skills are the bare minimum requirement for any managed IT service provider and iT360 has plenty&#8230;where the organisation really strives to stand out however, is in their ability to help customers take a strategic approach to IT.&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p><cite>James Robinson<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This required lifting the focus from technical support onto uncovering where customers are trying to go with their business and creating a strategy for using technology to help them get there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iT360 is operating in the new region through a new company, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/it-services-taranaki-lower-north\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"8469\">iT360 Lower North<\/a>, of which Robinson is a significant minority shareholder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iT360 is a partner of HPE, HP, Aruba, Microsoft, Veeam and Watchguard among others.
