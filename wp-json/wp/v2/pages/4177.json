Terms of Trade<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>iT360 Limited and any successor entity (\u201ciT360\u201d) will contract to sell and supply goods and services on these Terms and Conditions&nbsp;of Trade and the Credit Account Application only (together, the \u201cContract\u201d). By placing or confirming an order with iT360, the client&nbsp;is accepting these Terms and Conditions of Trade, and anything to the contrary in the client\u2019s\u2019s enquiries, orders or confirmations&nbsp;will not apply. The Contract supersedes any prior negotiations, agreements or undertakings between the parties and any waivers&nbsp;or variations to the Contract are only effective if made in writing and signed on behalf of iT360.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These Terms and Conditions of Trade apply to all \u201cbusiness customer\u201d sales only. That is, sales to a client which acquires goods&nbsp;and services from iT360 for the purposes of business use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Orders<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Orders must be in writing and addressed to iT360. The client may not cancel or vary an order once it has been placed or confirmed&nbsp;without iT360\u2019s written consent. iT360 has no obligation to enquire into the authority of any person placing orders on the client\u2019s&nbsp;behalf.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No order submitted by the client shall be deemed to be accepted by iT360 unless and until it is confirmed in writing by iT360\u2019s&nbsp;authorised representative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Prices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All prices quoted by iT360 are exclusive of GST unless specified otherwise. If GST is payable, it is payable by the client.&nbsp;iT360 reserves the right to alter the prices quoted in a quotation or tender provided to the client for the supply of goods or services&nbsp;(\u201cQuotation\u201d) to reflect increases or decreases in procurement costs which may have come to its notice after the date of the&nbsp;Quotation. In addition, iT360 reserves the right to withdraw or amend a Quotation unless the client has given written acceptance&nbsp;of the Quotation to iT360 within the time period specified in the Quotation. If no period for acceptance has been specified, the&nbsp;Quotation will be open for acceptance for thirty days from the date of the Quotation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some instances prices provided by iT360 within a Quotation may be calculated on the basis of a project or package of items.&nbsp;Variations in the scope of a project or package, or to project timescales, may affect the pricing of individual components and&nbsp;iT360 reserves the right to adjust the prices contained within the Quotation accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Payment Terms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The client must pay the price indicated on the invoice or other document or statement issued by iT360.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All freight, packaging and other relevant costs (if any) are charged to the client\u2019s account as shown on the invoice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Payment for goods and services supplied by iT360 to the client is due in accordance with the terms stated on the relevant invoice,&nbsp;or as otherwise agreed in writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where no payment terms are stated on the invoice, payment will be due on delivery of the goods or the provision of the services&nbsp;being Cash On Delivery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If credit has been granted to the client by iT360 by opening a 7 day account, the said invoice is due on or before the 7th day&nbsp;following the date of the invoice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a 20th of the month account, the said invoice is due for payment on or before the 20th of the month following the month the&nbsp;goods and\/or services are supplied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If at any time iT360 deems the credit of the client to be unsatisfactory, it may immediately terminate this contract or any other&nbsp;credit arrangements and require the client to pay the price on delivery of the goods or services. All costs and expenses of, or&nbsp;incurred by, iT360 as a result of the termination and recommencement of any credit arrangement are payable by the client upon demand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iT360 may charge interest on any moneys which are overdue under this Contract, commencing on the due date until the date of&nbsp;actual payment. The interest charged will be 2.5% per month calculated on a daily basis on the overdue amount until all amounts&nbsp;owed by the client are paid in full. The charging of interest does not imply the granting or an extension of credit. The client agrees&nbsp;to pay, on demand, all costs (including legal fees) incurred by iT360 or iT360\u2019s agents relating to the recovery of any amounts&nbsp;payable by the client to iT360.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All payments by the client must be made in full and without any deduction or right of set off or counterclaim. The client agrees,&nbsp;however, that all moneys which iT360 may owe the client on any account whatsoever may, at iT360\u2019s option, be set off against&nbsp;payments due by the client to iT360.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Intellectual Property<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The client acknowledges that iT360 (or its suppliers) are the sole owners or licensors of all intellectual property (including business&nbsp;know-how, methodologies, ideas, routines, systems and processes) relating or arising (directly or indirectly) to the client; or as&nbsp;otherwise developed or contributed to by iT360 (or its suppliers) in relation to any information, fault, repair or documentation that&nbsp;iT360 supplies to the client, or as a result of iT360 performing services or any other work for the client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The client covenants that any material provided by the client to iT360, and the use of it by iT360, for the purpose of supplying&nbsp;goods or services does not infringe any trade mark, copyright, patent, trade secret or any other proprietary right of any third party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Delivery<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Delivery of goods is deemed to be complete when made at the client\u2019s premises or any other premises agreed to in writing by&nbsp;iT360. On delivery, the goods are at the client\u2019s sole risk and with effect from the time of delivery, and in accordance with clause&nbsp;8 of these Terms and Conditions of Trade, the client will have in place all risks insurance to cover both its interest as bailee of the&nbsp;goods and iT360\u2019s interest as owner of the goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>iT360 may choose the carrier and the method of transport, unless otherwise agreed by iT360 in writing, and it may choose to&nbsp;deliver by instalments and may treat each delivery as a separate Contract. Should iT360 fail to deliver or make defective delivery&nbsp;of one or more instalments, this will not entitle the client to repudiate the Contract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If iT360 believes that the client may not make any payment when due, then it may suspend or cancel any delivery and iT360 shall&nbsp;not be held liable for non-delivery or late delivery (however caused), or failure to deliver by any specific method, means or vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Guarantee<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In consideration of iT360 supplying the Goods and Services on account, the Guarantor(s) PERSONALLY GUARANTEES jointly and&nbsp;severally payment upon demand of all monies owed by the client from time to time to iT360.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Guarantor(s) agrees to indemnify us at all times against all damages, claims, costs (including all legal costs), losses and&nbsp;expenses which we may suffer or incur as a breach by the client of their obligations under this Contract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Guarantor(s) further agrees:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(a) That they waive any right to require the client to proceed first against the Guarantor and agree that they are deemed to&nbsp;be liable as principal debtors under this Contract;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(b) That their obligations as Guarantor continue, notwithstanding:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (i) Any variation of this Contract;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) The liquidation, insolvency or receivership of the client;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) Any judgment iT360 obtains against the client;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>(c) That the guarantee in this clause is a continuing security and will not be discharge while, in iT360\u2019s opinion, any money&nbsp;is or may become owing under this Contract by the client or by the giving of time or any other act which would release&nbsp;the Guarantor\u2019s liability as surety only.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Retention of Title<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Title to ownership (both legal and equitable) in all goods delivered by iT360 to the client does not pass (and the client is a bailee&nbsp;only in respect of those goods) until payment in full is made for all such goods and other goods supplied by iT360 to the client.&nbsp;Until property has passed, the client will store all goods in such a way that they are clearly identifiable as the property of iT360.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the client has paid iT360 in full for all goods supplied, the client may not sell (unless such sale is in the ordinary course of the&nbsp;client\u2019s business), dispose of, or charge the goods and must hold or deal with the goods for and on behalf of iT360.&nbsp;However, if&nbsp;the goods are sold in the ordinary course of the client\u2019s business, prior to property passing to the client, the proceeds of that sale&nbsp;are held by the client on trust for and on behalf of iT360.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to the client acquiring full property in the goods, iT360 or iT360\u2019s agents may at any time enter upon any land, premises&nbsp;or property where it believes such goods may be to view and inspect them, and if the client has not paid for them in full retake&nbsp;possession of the goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. Force Majeure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If iT360 is prevented, hindered or delayed from complying with this Contract, or supplying goods and services in accordance with&nbsp;this Contract, by a Force Majeure Event, iT360 may at its option:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(a) Suspend deliveries while the Force Majeure Event continues;<br>(b) If iT360 has insufficient stocks to meet its commitments, apportion available stocks between its clients as it decides;&nbsp;and<br>(c) Terminate any orders placed by the client so affected, with immediate effect, by written notice to the client,&nbsp;and iT360 is not liable for any loss or damage suffered by the client as a result.

Export Terms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the goods are supplied for export outside New Zealand, the provisions of this clause 10 shall apply (subject to any special&nbsp;terms agreed in writing between the client and iT360), notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract. The client shall be responsible for complying with any legislation or regulations governing the importation of the goods into the&nbsp;country of destination and for the payment of any duties on them.&nbsp;The client shall be responsible for arranging for testing and inspection of the goods at iT360\u2019s premises before shipment. iT360&nbsp;shall have no liability for any claim in respect of any defect in the goods which would be apparent on inspection and which is&nbsp;made after shipment, or in respect of any damage during transit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>14.

The client and iT360 agree that this restraint of trade is reasonable in all the circumstances.&nbsp;However, if a court of competent jurisdiction finds it to be unenforceable, the client and iT360 agree to accept any modification of&nbsp;the duration of the restraint concerned which the court sees fit to impose, or if it does not see fit, which may be required to make&nbsp;the restraint enforceable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>19.
