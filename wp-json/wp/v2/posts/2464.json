Awesome&#8230;not!<\/span><br class=\"ac-designer-copy\"><br class=\"ac-designer-copy\"><span class=\"ac-designer-copy\">First things first, it\u2019s critical that we pay attention to this. Being in the industry we hear of far too many businesses out there getting hit with ransomware, having data stolen, and having business disruption that they don\u2019t need or deserve.<\/span><br class=\"ac-designer-copy\"><br class=\"ac-designer-copy\"><span class=\"ac-designer-copy\">There\u2019a a number of things we can do about this. We break this down into 3 main areas; the&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"ac-designer-copy\">Technology,<\/span><span class=\"ac-designer-copy\">&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"ac-designer-copy\">People and Processes. These are also called the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\">3 Pillars of Cyber Security<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span><br class=\"ac-designer-copy\"><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Main Cyber Security Areas to Focus On:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Firewalls &amp; Network Security Tools<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an ever-moving target. The tools we implemented for yesterdays problems aren\u2019t going to help us with tomorrows problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. People<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are we providing our people with Cyber or awareness training? It&#8217;s easy for Technology always get the focus, without the People side being addressed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Processes<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping Cyber on the agenda is critical. We&#8217;ve developed and brought together tools, frameworks, and assessments to help businesses identify gaps and plan for the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"280\" height=\"267\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/PPT-Diagram-Blog.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2481\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We have partnered with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kordia.co.nz\/news-and-views\/smart-hackers-rely-on-dumb-people\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kordia<\/a> to deliver fantastic cyber security training, called <strong>CyberWise<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>CyberWise<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aura Information Security, a division of Kordia, has been running staff cyber security training sessions for many years. Usually this involves training smaller groups of people in a workshop-based format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These work well but there was an opportunity to develop an e-learning platform that allowed customers to train larger groups of people, regardless of their geographic location; and also enabled staff to do the training at a time that suited them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>CyberWise is aimed at helping everyone in a business become more cyber-aware \u2013 from the guys working in the field, through to front-of-house staff and the finance team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyberwise-free-trial\/\">CyberWise here<\/a>, and register for your <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyberwise-free-trial\/\">free trial<\/a> of the software.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyberwise-free-trial\/\"><img width=\"300\" height=\"201\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/Blog-3-300x201.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2466\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While technology plays a big part in helping to defend businesses against cyber-attacks, the easiest target for cyber-criminals is often people.
