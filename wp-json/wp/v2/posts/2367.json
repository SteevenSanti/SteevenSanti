Cost-effective<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Using the cloud you pay only for the computing resources you use, rather than pre\u2010purchasing space and server equipment you may not need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Eliminating the use of servers, in turn, reduces the need for storage space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"toc\">\n<Strong>See Related:<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/cases\/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud\/\"> How Good Seed Trust (non-profit) Migrated 100% to the Cloud, Eliminated Server Issues, and Increased Productivity<\/a><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">2. Speed of Access<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">The speed of some servers and internal systems slows down the further you are away from them, which isn\u2019t great if you need files on the go. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Distance isn\u2019t an issue with cloud storage. The faster you get your hands on the information, the more efficiently your business runs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">3. Flexibility of space needed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Business\u2019 workloads can scale up or down regularly, and the cloud\u2019s capacity can adapt with you without the hassle of extra equipment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">4. Easy IT Management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">By taking out the manpower needed to run a complex internal IT function and replacing it with a user-friendly platform, business owners can focus on key goals. The cloud service offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/7-advantages-of-cloud-computing\/\">standardised platform<\/a> that allows for easy upgrades when needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">5. Environmentally Friendly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">A paperless cloud system uses fewer resources than a server-centric system. Your carbon footprint is smaller and more environmentally friendly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>It\u2019s important to be forward thinking and to take us into the  21st century. Good systems, less paper, less files and folders is part  of that.<\/strong><\/p><cite>Grace Ikiua, CEO, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/cases\/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud\/\">Good Seed Trust<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"p2\">Risks of Using the Cloud<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Cloud systems are <strong>not immune<\/strong> from data leaks or cyber attacks, but neither are servers or network storage. It\u2019s estimated cyber crime costs businesses $400 billion worldwide, not to mention the lost earnings that come from virus attacks, lost data and crashed systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Unfortunately, the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/which-employees-are-your-biggest-security-risk\/\">biggest security risk<\/a> to your business comes from within, especially the <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/organisation-phishing-targets\/\">top leaders in your organisation<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">All it takes to get inside your network is a <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach\/\">weak password<\/a> or an <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">employee innocently clicking on a line on an email<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"p2\"><strong>Before moving to the cloud, it is important that you:<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Assess all risks, create an inventory, and determine the potential outcome to your business<\/li><li>Determine the likelihood of these risks occurring and the residual risk it may have on your clientele.<\/li><li><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: inherit;\">Consider your likely responses to these risks and create a plan of action.<\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Your plan of action has to include both the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things\/\">technical and human elements<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">One technical solution is choosing infrastructures that incorporate security &#8211; rather than trying to add it to an existing legacy system. Often organisations focus on \u201cmaking the walls higher.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">These \u201chigher walls\u201d could include numbers of firewalls \u2014 which in turn will result in an increase in log files and alerts. None of this guaranteed to prevent attacks \u2010 especially if the danger is let in.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">This is why it\u2019s important to train your staff to understand threats and keep up with the latest cyber attack methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">It takes technology, processes and people working together to protect your cloud storage system and effectively counter cyber threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Cyber Security in the Workplace? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/cyber-security-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Guide to Cyber Security in the Workplace eBook\" class=\"wp-image-6708\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Computer technology is ever-evolving.
