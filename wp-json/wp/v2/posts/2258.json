Hardware Authentication<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach\/\">Usernames and passwords are less than secure<\/a>. Most of us use the same ones for a number of accounts. Or we use something that\u2019s easy to remember, and therefore easy to guess. Even worse, we have sticky labels with login details around our screens or written down on a piece of cardboard in your wallet. We need a more secure way to authenticate who we are online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel is working on a new processor to combat this problem. It\u2019s looking to include a user\u2019s identity and authentication within the computer\u2019s hardware. With a computer chipset, your device becomes the key and proves it should have access to a particular network. It restricts access and majorly beefs up your business\u2019 security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. User-Behaviour Analytics (UBA)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone gets your login details they will try to <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/6-it-virus-and-cyber-security-threats\/\">steal your identity<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most security focuses on stopping people from getting in. What if the network could tell that someone with your username and password wasn\u2019t you and let you know? This would close a serious gap in defense.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>UBA technology can compare your past, legitimate behaviour with what\u2019s currently happening on your account. It can also compare odd activity with others in your company in a similar role. User-behaviour analytics can raise a red flag that someone is doing something with their account that they shouldn\u2019t, or that someone has their access details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Deep Learning<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not quite artificial intelligence, but this emerging technology gets close. Instead of analysing user behaviour, the Deep Learning system looks at \u201centities\u201d from the micro to the macro level to see where legitimate or acceptable behaviour turns malicious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These machines will be able to determine what\u2019s good or bad software from what it\u2019s trying to do, and will be able to remove advanced threats, viruses and <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-terms\/\">malware<\/a> as soon as they appear, seriously improving cyber security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. The Cloud<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An online storage system most of us use every day. For many organisations it\u2019s <strong>replacing the need for on-site servers<\/strong>, but there are still major differences between cloud providers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more businesses make the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement\/\">transition to the cloud<\/a>, providers will need to build on-site security techniques like firewalls, intrusion and detection devices into their platform, making the infrastructure safer and more secure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A large cloud provider will almost certainly be able to do more cyber security on a larger scale to protect their clients than what most small businesses can achieve on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business IT can know when someone with your login details isn\u2019t you, will only allow access from certain devices or receives extra layers of security from a vigilant cloud service provider, your business will be much better protected. You just can\u2019t afford to ignore this emerging technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Online Security Protection for New Zealand businesses? <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/go\/online-security-for-nz-businesses\/ebook\/\" target=\"_blank\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE!<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/go\/online-security-for-nz-businesses\/ebook\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/online-security-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Online Security for New Zealand Businesses eBook\" class=\"wp-image-6707\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So you run a virus scan of your computer every now and again?
