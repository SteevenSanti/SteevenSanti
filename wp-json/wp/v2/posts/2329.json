In doing this, you can weed out any companies that do not have the capacity to meet your communication requirements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some key things to check before selecting an IT company:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Key Areas to Check Before Choosing an IT Partner<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Communication KPIs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>See if your IT company is willing to agree on some <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/why-you-should-set-kpis-for-your-it-company\/\">KPIs regarding communication<\/a>. For example, you could set a KPI to measure \u2018response time\u2019; how quickly they get back to you when you\u2019ve reached out for help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you decide on, put these KPIs in writing so you have something to refer to in the future if there is a communication breakdown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Face-to-face meetings and phone calls<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some IT professionals like to hide behind their computers and rarely engage in face-to-face or telephone contact. While emails are perfectly adequate most of the time, there are situations where you\u2019ll require verbal explanations to avoid things getting \u2018lost in translation\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What might take hours to explain via email could be resolved in a matter of minutes by picking up the phone. Make sure your chosen IT company has the capacity to accommodate these kinds of meetings on a regular basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Willingness to teach<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you first start working with an IT company, you might go through a steep learning curve as you process new information. This will be a lot easier if the IT professionals show a willingness to teach you about technologies you don\u2019t understand. While this may involve a time commitment in the beginning, in the long-run, it will allow for a more cohesive, productive relationship for both parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By conveying your communication expectations to your IT company in the beginning, you will set yourself up for a win, and avoid those dreaded \u2018tech-heavy\u2019 conversations later down the track.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want&nbsp;to know&nbsp;what&#8217;s big for IT this year?&nbsp;Download:&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/it-guide-sme-business\/\"><strong>An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/it-guide-sme-business\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/An-essential-guide-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Essential Guide to IT for SME Businesses\" class=\"wp-image-6699\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re not technologically-savvy, the thought of communicating with an IT expert might fill you with dread.
