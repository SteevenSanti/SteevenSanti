You can even send meeting reminders or reminders of all sorts to everyone. Isn\u2019t it much better than sending emails, and hoping people would remember?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Security\u00a0<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Security is especially important when you\u2019re handling the sensitive part of the project. Thinking about the serve consequences of data breach may already be giving you shivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emails can be vulnerable to data breaches, however, a collaboration tool will give you absolute control over your data.
