Read on&#8230;\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Dark Web\n<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren\u2019t familiar, the <strong>dark web<\/strong> is a small part of the internet where illegal activities are conducted. In short, these is where hackers and criminals buy and sell information. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let that sink in for one second. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your personal, identifiable information is sold\/traded around by people without you knowing\nabout it.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The why and how isn\u2019t important at this point. But what matters to you as leaders in your\norganisation is to know which accounts have been compromised.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These data can be in the form of: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>email addresses and passwords \u2014 including where you use them: social media, bank accounts, email<\/li><li>the address you live<\/li><li>credit card numbers<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Real Threats to Your Organisation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Example 1: Impersonating Your CEO<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if a cyber criminal gets hold of your CEO\u2019s or president\u2019s email. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hacker can easily send an email to treasury to pay a certain bank account immediately; otherwise, a shipment will be blocked, or a lawsuit might happen which will inevitably cost more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the person in treasury receiving that email, what do you think he\/she would do? Note that the email is valid \u2014 it came directly from the CEO or president. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a variety of tactics used here namely <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-terms\/#social-engineering\">social engineering<\/a> (impersonating the CEO) and probably taking advantage of a <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-terms\/#data-breach\">data breach<\/a> or lack of <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-terms\/#mfa\">multi-factor authentication (MFA)<\/a>.

Watch this video\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video describes multi-factor authentication (MFA) but presents a real-life scenario of a customer finding out that an email forwarding address has been set up in the account without their knowledge. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/kxlgfmbu2t.jsonp\" async=\"\"><\/script><script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/assets\/external\/E-v1.js\" async=\"\"><\/script><div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\"><div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_kxlgfmbu2t videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;position:relative;width:100%\"><div class=\"wistia_swatch\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/kxlgfmbu2t\/swatch\" style=\"filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" onload=\"this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;\" title=\"\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, imagine someone gaining access to all your emails and conversations? From your loved ones, your work, etc. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that person would have known who you\u2019re talking to, where you\u2019re going, where you live, what projects you\u2019re working on, and possibly the thoughts inside your head. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think will happen if the project you\u2019re working in is leaked to your competitors? What if someone posted sensitive <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few examples of how serious the ramifications are and why you need to\nprioritize cyber security in your organization.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Want to Find Out the Compromised\nAccounts in Your Organisation?\n<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of this article, I told you about a tool that we use that searches for compromised email addresses and passwords. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, the only thing you need to enter is your website.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What this tool does is search the dark web for the email addresses in your domain and\ncompile them into a PDF report.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what it looks like with the email addresses and passwords masked. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"916\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Screenshot_11_23_19__3_51_PM-1024x916.png\" alt=\"Sample Report with Passwords Hidden\" class=\"wp-image-6629\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This report will display the email address, the password, when it was discovered\/used in\nthe dark web, and where it happened (source of breach).\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purpose of this article, I masked\/hid the emails and passwords. But, in the report that you\u2019ll get from us, you will actually be able to see these passwords. This will give you specific, actionable steps on what to do in order to protect you and your business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why You Should Take Action Right\nNow\n<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, the implications of a breach is great. If your passwords are out there for everyone to see, there&#8217;s no telling what they&#8217;ll do with it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok, you might tell yourself, &#8220;these are business email addresses, I\u2019m pretty sure this won\u2019t affect me personally.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think again.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least <strong>83% of people reuse their passwords across multiple services<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just take a look at the <em>password column <\/em>of the image above. You\u2019d notice that there are several instances of the same email address compromised with the same password. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, answer these questions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Do you reuse your passwords? <\/li><li>How often do you change your passwords? <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re most people, you&#8217;re probably using the same password across the same set of services. For example, one password for all your online banking, and another for your social media accounts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even if you don\u2019t reuse your passwords, or change them regularly, as leaders in your organisation you have to look at this from a bigger perspective. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is most of the people in your organisation reuse their passwords. And that puts your entire business at risk. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>83% of people reuse their passwords across multiple services<\/p><cite><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cyclonis.com\/report-83-percent-users-surveyed-use-same-password-multiple-sites\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cyclonis<\/a><\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Risks Extend to Your Personal Life <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone gained access to your business email addresses and passwords, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked\/\">what do you think will happen<\/a> in your personal life, given that you most probably use the same passwords there too? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Financial\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider what would happen if someone can gain access to your online bank account?\nThey can easily transfer money to certain accounts or use your information to impersonate\nyou and steal something else.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reputation\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Or even worse, they can gain access to private information like getting <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/icloud-hacking-not-just-for-celebrities\/\">access to your iCloud account<\/a> and see your personal photos. These criminals can easily blackmail you to do illegal and shameful activities for them, or extort you for money. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Physical safety\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if these criminals found out where you live? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think would happen to your spouse and your family? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Over to You <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re on a mission to make the world we live in a safer place, one individual, one organisation at a time. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we want you and your organisation to get that peace of mind online.
