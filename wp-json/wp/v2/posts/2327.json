Regardless of team size or industry, sometimes the biggest challenge in a business can be getting everyone in a room to for a 30\u2010minute talk. Research has shown that over all the programmes, systems and software you can install, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things\/\">educating your employees about online security and mobile risk<\/a> is the best way to protect your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/risks-of-using-wireless-technology-in-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How employees use of mobile technology puts\u00a0your network security at risk<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Steps to Develop Online Security Awareness in Your Organisation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Create and Engage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to have a <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/no-cyber-security-policy\/\">basic security and information policy<\/a>. It can be included in employment contracts or employee handbooks, but is best discussed in person. Your policy should cover which devices each employee has access to and what they can be used for. Use the time to educate your team on how they can protect the company and why their actions are important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Younger generations often feel like their online actions are anonymous and have no real repercussions. It\u2019s hard to measure personal impact if the consequences happen in another part of the city, country or world. Overcoming this mind set is essential for building a mobile aware culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Measure and Monitor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is using firewalls, mobile device management (MDM) or policy engines to measure, monitor and enforce these policies. It\u2019s important that employees can still do their jobs without the added security impacting their usability or productivity. These programmes will also allow you to see if anyone is trying to access files, sites, or share information they shouldn\u2019t. This gives you a chance to chat with that person one\u2010on\u2010one and ensure they fully understand the policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Feedback and Adjust<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as social media allows two\u2010way conversation with businesses and clients, your <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/how-to-create-an-it-policy\/\">IT security policy<\/a> should also allow for employee feedback and requests. There\u2019s no benefit in having mobile aware staff if the security policy prevents them from doing their job properly. Policies and programmes can be changed to suit different requirements, so make sure there are opportunities for your team to have input.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>51% of employees across 23 countries surveyed by Aruba Networks said <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/using-it-to-mobilise-and-manage-your-workforce\/\">mobile technologies<\/a> enable them to be more productive and engaged. There\u2019s no way of avoiding it! In this day and age if a business tried doing away with cell phones, tablets and laptops it wouldn\u2019t take long to be left behind by their competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the always\u2010on, mobile office is here to stay, your best move for developing a mobile aware culture is working with changes. Take an adaptive policy approach to connectivity and data security that educates and encourages your employees while protecting your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Cyber Security in the Workplace? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\" edit=\"true\"><img width=\"273\" height=\"300\" class=\"wp-image-2264\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/A-guide-to-Cybersecurity-in-the-Workplace-273x300.png\" alt=\"free guide: cyber security in the workplace\" title=\"\"><\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over 80% of computer problems are caused by human error.
