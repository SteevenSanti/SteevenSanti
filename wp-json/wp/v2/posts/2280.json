Who<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Who is going to implement the ITRM strategy? Who is going to action it when\/if it is required? These need to be clearly set out in order for all personnel to understand what they have responsibility for \u2013 and this will ensure the procedures set out are effectively actioned when required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There also needs to be the appropriate level of authorisation given to those in charge of risk management, so they are able to carry out decision-making for situations where there isn\u2019t a defined path for resolution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. What<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the risks you face as an organisation? Think about all possible internal and external threats, and then set guidelines around what level of risk they pose to your business \u2013 as well as tolerance benchmarks to identify what course of action to take to rectify the issue&nbsp;that has occurred.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Where<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every business and organisation needs to have a plan for ITRM, and it needs to be kept visible for all of those involved in its development and implementation. It is important to have alignment throughout the company, and for the ITRM to be worked alongside with other business policies and procedures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. When<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Timings are critical for risk management response \u2013 so set up deadlines for when identified courses of action should be taken. And again, this can be separated out into each level of risk \u2013 to determine when a resolution should take effect, or when it needs to be escalated to a higher authority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Why<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as knowing what IT risks you f ace as a business, you should also be able to understand why they are an issue for your organisation. This can help with putting processes in place as to your course of action following risk infiltration.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, \u2018Why would it matter that our data was compromised?\u2019 Because it would mean private details of customers would be exposed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. How<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So following on from the above, how do you mitigate that risk? Whether it is by enhancing security, or putting other protection processes in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.\u00a0Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business?
