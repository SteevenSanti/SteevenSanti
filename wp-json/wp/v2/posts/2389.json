Many companies are looking for someone 24 \u2013 29 years old with 30+ years of experience so they can add the most value to their company with minimal risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you <em>realistically<\/em> identify which employees are your biggest security risk? Aruba Networks surveyed over 11,500 employees across 23 countries to find out. And as the saying goes, the numbers don\u2019t lie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 Statistics You Can&#8217;t Ignore Who Are Your Company&#8217;s Biggest&nbsp;Security Risk<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. The Weaker Sex<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Males are more likely to lose data than females. Men are 20% more likely to misuse a smartphone and lose personal or client data and 40% less likely than females to fall victim to identity theft.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/risks-of-using-wireless-technology-in-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How employee use of mobile technology puts your network security at risk<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. The Young Ones<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Those aged between 25 \u2013 34 years old are twice as likely to become identity theft victims or lose client data than someone over 55.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. More Money = More Problems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, those on higher incomes posed greater risk. Employees on $18K or less per year are half as likely to lose sensitive company data than those earning $60K.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, those earning over<strong> $75k were three times more likely<\/strong> to give out their password if offered money than employees making less than $18K.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Risky Business<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scarily, the <strong>finance industry has serious problems<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2 out of 5 people surveyed who work in financial institutions admitted to losing company data through mobile mismanagement. That\u2019s 25% higher than the average across all industries surveyed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Better Education Needed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly a third of education sector workers store passwords, login details and other sensitive data on a sheet of paper. Of all industries surveyed, <strong>those working in education are least likely to password protect personal&nbsp;smartphones<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What conclusions can we draw from this? Saying you want to hire women over 35 years old and pay them less to reduce your company\u2019s IT risks is likely to have the opposite effect. That\u2019s not a good risk management strategy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Know and Understand<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Show employees why you have security measures in place and how to use them. Also, teach employees about how their online behaviour can impact on your business, and the consequences of data breaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the self-obsessing younger generation more likely to engage in risky behaviour, they need to see how downloading an app from outside official app stores or opening emails from unknown senders will impact them as a part of your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about how to protect yourself online, you can enroll in our free <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\">cyber security<\/a> email series.

In some cases, these rules can be enforced with usage restrictions or two\u00adstage authentication to prevent employees from becoming lazy or careless with regards IT.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep It Up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know how much technology is released in a year? The world of IT is constantly updating, so refreshing your employees once a year on good practice and their IT responsibilities isn\u2019t going to cut it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scheduling quarterly meetings, or something more regular to update your system and remind employees of the importance of IT security will protect your business by reducing risky behaviour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Online Security Protection for New Zealand businesses? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/go\/online-security-for-nz-businesses\/ebook\/\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The employment marketplace is getting more competitive.
