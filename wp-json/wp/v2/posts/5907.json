It also offers video conference calls that support up to 250 people. Users can also transfer calls, and dial using real phone number if the other person isn\u2019t online. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of daily use, people can use it for online meetings especially for multi-location offices; or, more recently, because of the coronavirus pandemic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bottom line<\/strong>: Skype for Business is a robust communication tool.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Microsoft Teams have the same calling-functionality of Skype for Business, MS Teams is designed primarily for collaboration. The biggest differentiator is the latter&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/microsoft-teams-integration-with-other-apps\/\">integration with hundreds of apps<\/a> that extend its feature set further. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>MS Teams users have the ability to collaborate in real-time no matter where they are. For example, Skype allows you to share your screen during a video call, but only one person can make changes to a document. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With MS Teams, whether in a conference call or not, people can work on the same document at the same time within the app. This helps improve productivity because you don&#8217;t have to use multiple software nor have issues with <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/shared-storage-for-everyone-never-deal-with-duplicates-and-missing-files-again\/\">duplicate files<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is the provider of both software and part of the Microsoft 365 business package. Users&#8217; data are safe and secured under Microsoft strict compliances and enterprise-grade security.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Skype-for-Business-2019-vs-Microsoft-Teams-2020-1024x679.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6344\" title=\"\"><figcaption>Microsoft Team vs Skype for Business<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Skype vs Microsoft Teams: No Need to Choose<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Teams will takeover Skype for Business as internal communication AND collaboration platform. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations are not required to choose between the two.
