Below, we outline five signs it might be time to upgrade your protection. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 Signs You Need a New Antivirus Software<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Your business is growing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If business is booming, then first off \u2013 congratulations! But before you pop the champagne and start celebrating, it\u2019s important to make sure that your security software can scale with your business as it grows. The larger your organisation gets, the more protection it will need to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\">keep sensitive information safe<\/a>.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is especially true if you\u2019re hiring more employees and expanding your computer network. As more people enter the network, the higher the chances of <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/mounting-security-complexity\/\">systems being hacked or information going missing<\/a>. For peace of mind that your antivirus software can adequately protect your booming business, ask your provider, consult an IT specialist, or start shopping around for new products. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. You\u2019re using a free product<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several free antivirus software products available online.  These can be a great option for budget-conscious individuals (after all,  something is better than nothing), but most businesses require more robust protection. Free software may have served you well as a solopreneur, but if your business is expanding, it\u2019s probably time for an upgrade. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. You don\u2019t know what your software &#8216;does&#8217;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people treat antivirus software as a \u2018set-and-forget\u2019 tool,  trusting that it will automatically run in the background and alert you if anything is amiss. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is true for some products, it\u2019s good practice to understand how the software works and to make sure you are maximising it to its full potential. You may be missing out on key security features, or worse, overlooking problematic threats. Consider reading these <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind\/\">15 cyber security myths you should stop believing in 2019<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. You\u2019ve had a virus since installing the software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p> If your computer has been affected by a virus since installing an antivirus product, then this could be a telltale sign that your software is not up to the task. Perhaps it\u2019s not sophisticated enough? Or maybe it\u2019s not being updated on a regular basis? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to identify the cause of the virus and see if you can avoid the same problem occurring again with new antivirus software. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more<\/strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/6-it-virus-and-cyber-security-threats\/\">6 virus and cyber security threats to your business<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. You\u2019re using outdated software<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Viruses and hackers are evolving at an extraordinary pace, and the only way to stay one step ahead of them is to make sure your cyber security strategy is as up-to-date as possible. This means using antivirus software by a reputable provider who is constantly enhancing the product to keep out new threats as they arise.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your software is outdated, it won\u2019t stand a chance against sophisticated malware. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best antivirus products on the market is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.watchguard.com\/wgrd-products\/security-services\/gateway-antivirus?referral=it360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gateway Antivirus<\/a>,  developed by WatchGuard.
