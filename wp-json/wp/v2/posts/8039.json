Teams vs Channels&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with some basics.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Teams has two main areas. The left column which comprises of different tabs and sections, and the right column which contains the contents of each of those sections.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"616\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ch6_teams_channels_section-1024x616.png\" alt=\"Teams and Channels in MS Teams\" class=\"wp-image-7202\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since MS Teams is the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/why-your-team-wants-teams\/\">hub for teamwork<\/a>, the area where you\u2019ll spend your time the most is the Teams and Channels tab.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside Microsoft Teams, Teams are groups of people brought together for work, projects, or common interests.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"616\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ch6_teams_channels-1024x616.png\" alt=\"Difference Between Teams and Channels\" class=\"wp-image-7205\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Teams are made up of channels. Each channel is built around a topic like team events, a department name, or just for fun.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Channels are where you hold meetings, have conversations, or work on files together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Show\/Hide Non-Relevant Teams and Channels<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on how big your organization is, or what teams you are a part of, this section will have a lot displayed, or little.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good part is that you can customize what you want to appear in this section by hovering over the ellipses (\u2026) and choose which channel you want to hide.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way, only the teams and channels that are important to you appear on the menu. This will help you focus on work, rather than reading through every single notification you see on your screen.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Customization Through Apps and Files<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best features that makes MS Teams stand out from its competitors is the tabs section. These are located at the top of each channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"337\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ch6_teams_channels_tabs-1024x337.png\" alt=\"Customise Different Tabs\" class=\"wp-image-7204\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you can find \u201capps\u201d and files that allow you to work directly INSIDE Teams with your colleagues.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, your organization uses Asana to manage projects and keep track of tasks. You can add it by clicking on the plus (+) icon.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you finish setting this up, everyone who has access to the channel can work on the file\/app together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"617\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/ch6_teams_channels_tabs_asana-1024x617.png\" alt=\"Asana Inside Tabs in Teams\" class=\"wp-image-7203\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, let\u2019s say one of the things you regularly do is update an Excel or PowerPoint regularly. You also need to work with other people to get the data for different sections of the file.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, you do this by finishing your work, saving the file, then emailing it to your colleague. They will, in turn, add their part, save it, email it to the next person. You all do this until you get the final version ready.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can easily do this inside Team without the need for moving or opening another app. If several people are working together on a report, they won\u2019t have to send multiple versions to one another.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything just becomes so much simple.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s Next<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Teams and Channels tab\/area\/section is where you and your team will spend your time in the most. Spend a couple of minutes thinking about how you\u2019re going to set this up to make it easy for everyone to work together.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next chapter, I\u2019ll share more about the different ways you can communicate \/ collaborate inside MS Teams.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are various ways to use MS Teams in your organization.
