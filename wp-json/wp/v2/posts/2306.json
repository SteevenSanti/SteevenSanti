In a nutshell, it is a place where your data, as well as all online aspects of your business, can be stored securely \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t need you to manage or maintain it. It is also pretty much infinite in size, so you never have to worry about running out of space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7 Advantages of Cloud Computing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Flexibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned in a previous article, having the ability to scale bandwidth when required is an extremely valuable&nbsp;resource to have as a part of your business strategy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Cost reduction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud computing allows a business to reduce spend on <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure\/\">technology infrastructure<\/a> and capital cost expenditure, so of course that is an advantage for any business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Improves accessibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to providing work-from-anywhere access having cloud computing means employees are able to retrieve all the same systems as if they were in the office.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Monitor projects more effectively<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With data and\/or project information held in a location that is accessible to all appropriate employees, it is easier to get a quick, accurate picture of work flows \u2013 particularly since updates and changes are in real-time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Process big data<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In an earlier post, we discussed the\u00a0<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/what-is-big-data-and-how-does-an-it-company-assist-your-business-to-process-it\/\" target=\"_blank\">value of big data for your business<\/a>, but without the use of cloud computing,\u00a0it would be extremely difficult (and costly) to capture and store the information required to process your big data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Easy recovery<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Disasters happen, things go wrong and every business is at risk of virus\u2019 wiping important data and information \u2013 but by working in the cloud, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/protecting-critical-data-in-your-business\/\">data recovery<\/a> is quick and easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Document control<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With a central storage point for documents, silos of information are no longer an issue, and it allows those&nbsp;responsible for document control to have complete visibility over all relevant data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The list above is by no means exhaustive on the benefits of working in the cloud. And the fact is, it\u2019s where businesses are going, so if you\u2019re not there now, no doubt you will need to be in five years time to ensure your capabilities meet the expectations of your employees, clients and customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.\u00a0Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business?
