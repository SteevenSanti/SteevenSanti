It&#8217;s important you do a little checking to ensure your business data is safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7 Things to Consider Before Moving Your Business Data to the Cloud<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">1. Someone Else Has It<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Using Cloud storage means you don\u2019t have to buy costly server equipment, store it and maintain it. It\u2019s easy and efficient to use someone else\u2019s technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">That does mean someone else has control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Some Cloud providers include file encryption, or you can use your own to add extra security, but that risk is always there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">2. No Standardisation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Every Cloud provider offers something different. There are no laws or regulations around this service, which can make comparing companies difficult. It\u2019s best to do some background checking before deciding on one and uploading all your files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">3. Lack of Support<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">What happens if you need help? If you\u2019re a paying customer a help line is only a call away, but that may not be the case if you\u2019re using free software. Again, check reviews of the Cloud provider to see what their support system is like to avoid nasty surprises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">4. Cyber Attacks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">If it\u2019s connected to the internet, then it is vulnerable. In 2014, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/icloud-hacking-not-just-for-celebrities\/\">hackers broke into the Apple Cloud accounts of a number of celebrities<\/a>, releasing their sensitive photos. Make sure whoever you choose to trust your company information with has comprehensive security measures to keep your data safe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">5. Liability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">If your data is breached, what happens? Does the fault lie with you or the Cloud owner? Some companies provide <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-insurance\/\">cyber security insurance<\/a> in case your data is hacked and released online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Compensation is often limited, so it pays to check the fine print of your user contract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p2\">6. Outages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">When you control your own server, most of the time you know what\u2019s happening. When a Cloud storage system goes down, you won\u2019t know until you try and access it.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.neowin.net\/news\/heres-why-microsoft-azure-faced-a-global-outage-yesterday\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.informationweek.com\/cloud\/infrastructure-as-a-service\/amazon-disruption-produces-cloud-outage-spiral\/d\/d-id\/1322279\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon<\/a>,&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/us\/dropbox-outage,news-30270.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dropbox<\/a>&nbsp;cloud systems have had outages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">You can\u2019t know how long the problem will last,&nbsp; or control what\u2019s happening. Thankfully in those instances backups kicked in and no major data was lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p1\">7. Shared Storage<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Unless your Cloud provider can guarantee your company will have a sole server, you\u2019ll probably be sharing with another business. That\u2019s just the nature of public technology. If a virus manages to infect one business, it can possibly spread to other businesses on that Cloud system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Yes, there are risks to using the Cloud to store your data. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not safe or you shouldn\u2019t do it. You risk your computer, laptop, tablet or phone every time you use the internet, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to stop going online!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">Cloud companies are getting stronger every day as the technology develops, boosting security and providing more transparency to users. Whoever you sign up with, do your research beforehand, and always <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1\/\">keep your own backup copy<\/a>, just in case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Online Security Protection for New Zealand businesses? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/go\/online-security-for-nz-businesses\/ebook\/\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are thinking of moving your business information into online Cloud storage, note not all clouds are the same.
