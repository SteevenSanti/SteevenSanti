When you look at 10, or even just 5 years ago, you would have noticed that there are more companies today with products\/solutions to problems that didn\u2019t exist years ago. <\/p>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-5fe4edb8b541c\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What are the challenges Kiwi businesses need to overcome?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>There are a lot of challenges facing a lot of New Zealand businesses, but they all fall under these three categories: (1) more competition than ever, (2) changing buying behavior, and (3) looming online security threats. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-5fe4edb8b541f\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">How can one overcome these challenges? <\/h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>While there is no single proven way to succeed in business, a common theme among the successful ones is that they have a modern workforce. <\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>When you use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mindtools.com\/pages\/article\/newTMC_08.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Porter\u2019s Five Forces<\/a> \u2014 a framework for analyzing a company, market, or industry \u2014 you\u2019ll realize that the market is more saturated than ever with tons of alternatives\/ substitutes, and changing buyer\u2019s behaviors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is, therefore, imperative that businesses today <strong>strive to develop an unfair advantage<\/strong> in their industry or market in order to become successful. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Challenges Every New Zealand Business Must Overcome<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge 1: More Competition<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick-and-dirty analysis using Porter\u2019s 5 Forces reveals that almost every industry are in\nthe same situation. But before that, here\u2019s a quick recap on the five forces:\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li> <strong>Competitive rivalry<\/strong> \u2014 looks at the number and strength of your competitors. When rivalry is intense, companies often attract customers using price cuts. But when there\u2019s minimal (or no) competition, the stronger your position is with healthy profits. <\/li><li> <strong><g class=\"gr_ gr_21 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"21\" data-gr-id=\"21\">Threat<\/g> of new entrants<\/strong> \u2014 refers to the ability of other people to enter your market. If it takes little money and effort to enter your market, or if others can replicate the technology you\u2019re using, then rivals can quickly enter your market and weaken your position. <\/li><li> <strong><g class=\"gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"12\" data-gr-id=\"12\">Threat<\/g> of substitutes<\/strong> \u2014 the likelihood of your customers finding a different way of doing what you offer. If what you do can be replaced by something else available in the market, what\u2019s stopping your customers from doing so? <\/li><li><strong>Bargaining power of buyers<\/strong> \u2014 how many buyers do you have and how big are their orders? How much would it cost them to switch to your competitors? When you deal with a few buyers, they have more power to dictate terms to you. <\/li><li> <strong>Bargaining power of sellers<\/strong> \u2014 how easy is it for your suppliers to increase their prices; how many suppliers do you have? The fewer suppliers there are, the more you need their help and the stronger their position and their ability to charge you more. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This framework is often used to determine an industry\u2019s attractiveness or assess the company in terms of its environment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take, for example, a fictional web development company called Best Web Agency. If you look at the competitors within the segment, there are a lot of them. There are <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">indi- vidual<\/g> freelancers, companies <g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">and<\/g> agencies doing website development services. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The barriers to entry in this industry are also individual. Anyone with design and programming experience can start offering these kinds of services. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, there are a lot of drag-and-drop website builders that can act as an alternative\nto the services Best Web Agency can offer. There are countless pre-built templates regard-\nless of which platform the user chooses. All these factors make it difficult to stand out in\nthis market.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge 2: People\u2019s Buying Behavior Has Changed <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The internet has also changed the way people buy \u2014 both online and offline. It decentralized the buying process in that businesses can no longer withhold information that may prove useful in the buying cycle without it affecting them negatively later on. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, before the internet, buying a laptop means going to a store, talking to sales\npeople, and deciding on which model to purchase.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salespeople can opt not to share some important pieces of information like battery life or\npower consumption, which may make some buyers hesitate. But with the internet, con-\nsumers no longer <em>need <\/em>to ask and get these information from salespeople. They just search\nfor reviews online and make their decisions long before talking to someone from your com-\npany.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Challenge 3: Looming Online Threat\n<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, there is a continued rise of a new kind of threat \u2014 cyber attacks. With more and\nmore people relying on using the internet for their daily needs, it\u2019s imperative that you equip\nnot only yourself with the knowledge and tools but also your staff.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">84% of cyber security breaches<\/a> were caused by human error. This means that even if you are careful yourself, your staff might not have the same level of awareness. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, about 70% of all SMBs have been targeted by a cyber attack in 2018. Unfortunately, most of them didn\u2019t realize and weren\u2019t prepared for these attacks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These three challenges have to be faced by New Zealand business owners like you if you want to remain competitive, relevant, and successful. You must strive to develop an unfair advantage in your own industry. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more in our newest white paper on what an unfair advantage looks like \u2014 what qualities do modern and successful New Zealand businesses have and do that others don&#8217;t. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<script async=\"\" data-uid=\"6dbc66d83a\" src=\"https:\/\/it360-limited.ck.page\/6dbc66d83a\/index.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<a data-formkit-toggle=\"6dbc66d83a\" href=\"https:\/\/it360-limited.ck.page\/6dbc66d83a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/4-critical-challenges-CTA-1-1024x512.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5844\" title=\"\"><\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today\u2019s business landscape has changed a lot.
