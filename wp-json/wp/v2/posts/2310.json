It&#8217;s also one of <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\">the crucial areas in cyber security<\/a> you need to have in place. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your business grows, you will need to invest in more sophisticated tools to protect your technology and prevent it from falling. One of the most important tools to consider is <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/iot-network-and-endpoint-security-challenges\/\">network monitoring software<\/a>, which scans&nbsp;for problems \u2013 from frozen servers to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\">security threats<\/a>&nbsp;and everything in between. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitoring itself is automated with software or tools, and as soon as a problem is detected the network administrator (either yourself or your IT partner, depending on the size of your business) is notified.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sooner you find out there is a problem, the sooner you can take steps to find an appropriate solution. If your business is very small, it\u2019s probably relatively easy to keep track of everything yourself. But as soon as you hire staff and employ multiple devices across a network, there\u2019s a risk of missing important  IT reports and warnings. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network monitoring gives you peace of mind that if there\u2019s a problem, you will be notified. However, the cost of using network monitoring tools can be high. As a  budget-conscious business owner, how do you protect your network without spending a fortune? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do you protect your network without spending a fortune?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to find a way to measure the return on investment (ROI).  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already have a network monitoring system in place, figure out whether it is saving you money and adding value to your business. The best way to measure ROI is to calculate the \u2018time saved\u2019 thanks to your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies\/\">network monitoring<\/a>&nbsp;software. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How long would it have taken to identify and fix the problems without the software?<\/li><li>How would have this impacted staff productivity through downtime and network outages?<\/li><li>And how many support calls would you have had to make?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Conducting this simple ROI exercise can help you see the value in network monitoring software, but you should still shop around to make sure you are getting the best deal for your business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do your due diligence and collect quotes from various network monitoring suppliers so you can compare the pros and cons of each one. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At iT360, we can recommend the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.watchguard.com\/wgrd-products\/security-services\/network-discovery?referral=it360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WatchGuard Network Discovery<\/a>&nbsp;tool.  Not only is this an affordable option, but it also comes with a simple 1-click integration function, meaning it can easily connect to other WatchGuard products such as firewalls and traffic monitoring tools. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Network monitoring is an expense \u2013 but like many expenses, the cost of not employing a solution across your network could be much higher. Business leaders need to realise that cyber&nbsp;security is a big <strong>deal.&nbsp;It affects&nbsp;reputation, internal communication and even company culture.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\">Download our free guide<\/a>&nbsp;to better understand<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/cyber-security-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Guide to Cyber Security in the Workplace eBook\" class=\"wp-image-6708\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Network monitoring is an essential expense for most businesses, but it\u2019s important to research the different tools available so you don\u2019t get ripped off.
