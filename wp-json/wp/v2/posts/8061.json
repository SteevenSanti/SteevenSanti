Click on the plus (+) icon to add another tab. You\u2019ll be presented with several apps there. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t find the app you&#8217;re looking for, you can try searching for it here. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Select the app you want. You then set it up by giving MS Teams access to it (kind of like when you use an email client like Outlook and you want to access your Gmail accounts).\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s from here where the process\/steps deviate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1.

You and your team can now manage this particular project without leaving MS Teams.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.

Working on a report \u2014 PowerPoint<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This process is very similar to the previous one (Excel). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever wondered how to eliminate the constant emailing back-and-forth of reports? You send one version, then Sally adds their revision, then sends it back not knowing John was also working on a few edits. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you have three different file versions\u2014an updated one from Sally and another from John. So, which one do you use? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to reduce this confusion, save everyone time, and save a lot of emails and disk space, add it on to MS Teams and edit their in real-time together. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s Next<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft Teams calls itself as the hub for teamwork.
