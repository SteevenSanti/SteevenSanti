With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.govt.nz\/our-work\/diseases-and-conditions\/covid-19-novel-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">28 confirmed cases<\/a> in New Zealand as of 19 March, the government has stepped in to protect Kiwis both in the private and public sector. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, businesses are being forced to adopt flexible work arrangements to protect their staff, customers, and partners. That means implementing <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/services\/remote-work\/\">remote work or working from home<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, most Kiwi businesses aren&#8217;t prepared for this. That&#8217;s why we put together several free resources to help you cope in this situation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Free Microsoft Teams and Remote Work Training Webinars<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication and collaboration is key to situations like this. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the tools that can help with this is <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/services\/microsoft-teams\/\">Microsoft Teams<\/a>. It&#8217;s a tool that we also use internally that allows everybody in the organisation to chat, call, and collaborate in one app. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about MS Teams, we&#8217;re conducting a series of free webinar training next week.
