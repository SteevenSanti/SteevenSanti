She is not your typical chief information security officer. Hilary is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;Security Culture expert, a Psychologist,&nbsp;an author,&nbsp;an IT and business transformation leader&nbsp;and&nbsp;a mother of 3.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also&nbsp;wants to make the world a better place by inspiring more diversity in the Tech sector.&nbsp;When recounting what&nbsp;AUT lecturer and She# founder Dr Mahsa&nbsp;Mohaghegh&nbsp;said that&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/idealog.co.nz\/tech\/2019\/06\/steps-forward-still-some-way-go-women-nz-tech-weigh-key-takeaways-myobs-women-tech-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cThe stats about women in leadership are also concerning, with only 25 percent of local tech business having equal representation in this space. This is another situation that really needs to change to help improve the stats across the board,\u201d<\/a> we&nbsp;knew we had to speak to Hilary about her viewpoints&nbsp;on this subject.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How do you feel the role of women in tech has evolved over the last decade?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slowly, too slowly. I think back to my experience of growing up. The first job I wanted to do was to be an astronaut, then it was a vet, and then, I hit society and the only job I could see in business for a woman was to be a secretary. Now there is nothing wrong with being a secretary of course, but it does illustrate that a young girl full of dreams and&nbsp;aspirations,&nbsp;is affected by what they see reflected in&nbsp;society. At university, I did&nbsp;actually work&nbsp;part time as a receptionist, and I think that\u2019s when I realised that all the&nbsp;studying,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;doing,&nbsp;was so that I could do something else, and the dreamer kicked back in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&nbsp;is important to acknowledge that I have had a privileged upbringing.\u202f While I have grown up in a patriarchal society no doubt, as a white middle-class woman I was lucky to have had great schooling and extracurricular opportunities, a great group of supportive friends as well as all the basics like food on the table and parents who loved me without boundaries and who believed I could be, and should be, anything I wanted to be \u2013 the \u201cyou go girl\u201d mentality was firmly embedded.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as women in tech are concerned, the number of focused efforts to get more girls and women into tech&nbsp;are&nbsp;certainly helping and need to continue. My experience of speaking to students at universities and&nbsp;polytechs&nbsp;about tech and security is, that over half of the classes are women. So,&nbsp;we are certainly attracting more and more to the industry, which is fantastic. The thing I worry about is that we are not keeping them in tech.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women are self-opting out usually when they hit the $70-$100k roles, which tends to coincide with the thought of how they are going to manage being mothers AND being women in tech. Being in tech&nbsp;they&nbsp;are&nbsp;maybe more likely to have a male manager,&nbsp;and they are looking around at how other women going on maternity leave are treated and the career pathways, or not, before them. They are leaning back from their careers when they should be&nbsp;leaning in&nbsp;(as Cheryl Sandberg would say) to jobs that are rewarding, enjoyable and are worth being away from&nbsp;baby&nbsp;for. They think&nbsp;\u2018my salary is only just covering our childcare, it\u2019s not worth it, I should just stay home\u2019, but that sets them up for opting out of higher paid tech roles in the future and reduces their future earning potential. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;short term thinking.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Do you feel women are being given enough of a platform in this space?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see many good platforms to celebrate women in tech now,&nbsp;example the&nbsp;Reseller News Women in ICT Awards being one of those, which is extremely positive. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a hot subject and one with much interest and attention because of its importance to&nbsp;fuelling&nbsp;the tech sector with skilled people and because it&nbsp;is the right thing to do.&nbsp;However, there is still lots of work to do in&nbsp;workplaces, and generally at the management, senior management and Executive level, as so&nbsp;many&nbsp;trickles down from the top. For example, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;common that a male will get praise for their technical&nbsp;skill&nbsp;and a&nbsp;woman&nbsp;will get praise for their organisational skills \u2013 even though both are in technical roles. We need to&nbsp;remember,&nbsp;that&nbsp;the patriarchy&nbsp;is a system, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not a bunch of bad people. It&nbsp;is a system that has run for hundreds&nbsp;of years and that it takes time&nbsp;change&nbsp;mindsets. It&nbsp;is also a system that has meant that males too have often had to conform to the stereotype of being aggressive,&nbsp;un-emotional&nbsp;and dominating. And there are lots of males out there that that does&nbsp;not&nbsp;suit, as much as it has&nbsp;not&nbsp;suited all women to be outsiders, be likeable and be dominated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Are we introducing our young girls into this field as much as we should and what can be done better?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we think about changing mindsets, it means we need to check ourselves&nbsp;and also&nbsp;others,&nbsp;and keep the discussion going. It is so embedded that I even catch myself conforming to societal norms with women being pigeonholed one way and men being pigeonholed another.\u202f For example,&nbsp;I have two boys and a girl. And truth be told, there are times I have guided my little girl to maternal things like dolls and prams, instead of science things like planets and stars.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not easy to make sure you provide all the right experiences for children, or people in the workplace, so that they see technology as&nbsp;viable&nbsp;options. The point is I&nbsp;am&nbsp;trying,&nbsp;and we need to keep up the effort and \u2018check\u2019 ourselves and each other more often.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another keen crucial thing to be done is a fairer representation of women in senior management and executive technology roles. It\u2019s hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;what we don\u2019t see.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>And a one-liner word of wisdom&nbsp;you can&nbsp;give to women in this field and in general?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You belong. Don\u2019t pretend to be it, just decide and be it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interview with Saba Samiei<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Saba&#8217;s mission in life is to do her best in creating a better future for humanity and all that lives around us. She has quite&nbsp;a diverse&nbsp;experience in the tech industry from hands-on coding to leading multi-million-dollar&nbsp;transformation projects. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Saba-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Saba Samiei \" class=\"wp-image-8233\" width=\"341\" height=\"512\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Saba developed an in-depth passion for artificial intelligence back in 2017 and has dedicated her life outside of work to this topic ever since.&nbsp;In 2017, Saba was recognised as the top 3 finalists in New Zealand CIO emerging leader awards and top 4 finalists in Women of Influence Young leader awards. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019 she has been recognised as New Zealand Reseller News 30 under 30 and has recently won the Rising Star awards at Reseller News NZ Women in ICT awards. Saba has recently founded her own company called Comfort.AI with the intention&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;artificial intelligence the comfort zone of her audience. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She is also contracting at Microsoft as a partner development manager, helping New Zealand businesses grow using Microsoft technology. Saba&#8217;s motto in life is &#8220;I&#8217;ll find a way or make one!&#8221;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>How do you feel the role of women in tech has evolved over the last&nbsp;decade?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot&nbsp;speak of the last decade or compare it with the time prior to that as I have only been in the workforce for 8 years. What I do know is that while a lot of progress has been made there is still a lot more work to be done not just to embrace gender diversity but all types of diversity example&nbsp;talent, culture, sexual orientation, disability etc. I also know that women bring a compassionate side to the business which is fundamental to embracing diversity and creating an inclusive work culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>You won an amazing award recently. Tell us more about this and what it meant to you and for women of your&nbsp;generation?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ha-ha! Yes, I am very humbled by this recognition. The award that I won was Reseller News NZ, Women in ICT award, rising star category. This category and award&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;women with less than 8 years of experience who demonstrate a commitment to continuous career advancement with a proven desire to reach the next level of professional development. I came to New Zealand as a&nbsp;22-year-old,&nbsp;from a completely different world with no family or friends here. I had no idea of the country I was coming to and what the future was going to be like. I only had one very clear goal in mind and that was to be a good citizen of this new world and&nbsp;everyday&nbsp;be a better version of myself. This meant that I was and still am competing with myself every day, and as someone who has her head down and works continuously,&nbsp;I sometimes lose sight of what I have achieved. This award meant&nbsp;too&nbsp;much to me because it was a good reminder of my achievements over the last 8 years. I also think for anyone who gets nominated, makes&nbsp;it as&nbsp;a finalist or wins this award&nbsp;it shows them the same level of appreciation. I am thankful to RSNZ for sponsoring this&nbsp;every year! \u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Do you feel women are being enough of a platform in this space?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the industry as it stands today is built on some legacy mindsets and anyone with a different voice than that of the existing ones disrupts the status quo and therefore can and will be treated differently. This happens to you regardless of your&nbsp;gender&nbsp;however, because most of this legacy mindset was built on a more male centric view, women see and feel these differences the most. From what I see, we have come a long&nbsp;way,&nbsp;but we also have a long way to go. The day we no longer need \u2018women in XX\u2019 initiatives or the day that you no longer see news headlines like \u201cFirst women in a particular job\u201d is the day that we can say women are being enough of a platform.&nbsp;Same&nbsp;goes for all other traits of diversity. \u202f\u202f&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>You are regarded as a thought leader when it comes to AI. Do you feel the industry is introducing enough young women into this specific field quickly enough or even doing enough to encourage women to participate in it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No,&nbsp;I don\u2019t. I think we do&nbsp;not&nbsp;have enough people being encouraged to learn about AI in general and specifically women in this field are incredibly rare to find. I think this has some to do with the fact that the education system always plays catch up when it comes to new technologies as opposed to being a leading industry and encouraging young people to learn.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And&nbsp;also,&nbsp;some to do with the fact that there is this perception of AI that is a complicated tech and therefore requires a lot of STEM knowledge to get your head around it. We already see&nbsp;lack&nbsp;of women in STEM so, naturally we see a lack of women in AI too. I also think with AI growing at the pace that it is growing&nbsp;now and other upcoming technologies it is of utmost importance that we start educating people of all ages and all levels about AI and what the future could look like. Most importantly we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;help the next generation be change&nbsp;resilient. Women&nbsp;in particular need&nbsp;to participate in shaping the future of AI, we have seen time and time again how biased AI can be and this is not the fault of the&nbsp;technology,&nbsp;but it roots in the fact that our data as humans is quite biased and we need to&nbsp;change&nbsp;that. We need to change that fast!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>You started your own AI company. Can you tell us what inspired you to go this route and what fears you encountered along the&nbsp;way?&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, my company is called Comfort.AI and my motto is \u201cMaking artificial intelligence your comfort zone.\u201d I have been an AI Ethics researcher for four years and&nbsp;still&nbsp;going. One of the biggest dangers that I have identified via my research is lack of awareness about AI. AI is an industry with billions of investment dollars globally and according to The World Economic Forum it will increase our global economy by 16 trillion dollars (you can buy 8 companies the size of Apple with that money!), this means the impact that AI will have on our lives is significant. Comfort.AI is dedicated to educating people in the industry as well as&nbsp;the society&nbsp;and&nbsp;the schools&nbsp;about artificial intelligence. This includes workshops for C-Suit, middle management and end user in the companies as well as research services and consulting services to help companies navigate through this world of AI as opposed to investing in projects that they are not clear about the outcome of. Also, a percentage of the company\u2019s revenue is dedicated to educating the society about AI via free workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Any one-liner advice you can give to other women starting off in this field or in general&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always live by a personal motto in my life and I advise that to anyone who believes in it too \u2013 Don\u2019t take no for an answer, find a way or make one!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The gender discussion continues to be an intriguing one when it comes to the Tech sector.
