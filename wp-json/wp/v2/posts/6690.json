Apart from having bigger budgets, the main reason for this is big brands have discovered a secret \u2014 something that SMBs are still figuring out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern and successful New Zealand businesses have three things in common:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>More productive than others<\/li><li>At low risk of getting hacked and breached<\/li><li>Laser-focused on their customers<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have noticed, the successful ones <strong>don\u2019t fight fires everyday<\/strong>. They focus on the future, rather than on simply surviving the now.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the idea is easy to grasp, it\u2019s difficult to achieve.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, there has to be systems in place \u2014 for everything. That\u2019s how McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks can simply open up a new store and produce the same burger or Frappucino the same way, no matter where you order it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, this takes time to develop. You can\u2019t achieve these qualities overnight. You have to put in the time and effort. You need to invest in people and the right infrastructure and systems. And you need to make it stick.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, let\u2019s explore the three qualities more of modern and successful New Zealand businesses below.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Qualities of Modern and Successful New Zealand Businesses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Increased Productivity<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern and successful businesses \u2014 those who\u2019ve developed an unfair advantage \u2014 are more productive than their counterparts. Apple and Google have employees&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3068771\/how-employees-at-apple-and-google-are-more-productive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40% more productive than the average company<\/a>. While there are a lot of factors discussed in that research, what\u2019s important to note is that this increased productivity gives them an edge over other companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a Bain &amp; Company partner Michael Mankins, \u201cThey get more done by 10 a.m. Thursday morning than the others do in a week, but they don\u2019t stop working.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Questions to ask yourself:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Are you constantly hitting your deadlines or missing them?<\/li><li>What about campaigns or product launches \u2014 are you on time? Or always late? Always remember to consider opportunity costs.&nbsp;<ul><li>If you\u2019re set to launch a product\/service on March, but got delayed for 3 months, you lost any potential revenue you could have earned during those 3 months. And this doesn\u2019t even include the additional costs you spent during those extra 3 months.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>What\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/automation-is-changing-everything\/\">causing inefficiencies<\/a> in your organization? Is it because of the people? The tools and systems?&nbsp;<\/li><li>Can you <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/digital-transformation-modern-business-requirement\/\">work on-the-go<\/a>? Or do you have to stay in your office in front of your computer in order to do anything?&nbsp;<\/li><li>Are duplicate files and multiple file versions an issue you face each day?&nbsp;<\/li><li>Can you easily find other documents, or do you spend hours tracking and locating them?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Reduced Security Risks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another quality of modern and successful businesses is they have reduced security risks. In other words, they are not in danger or at risk of getting their data stolen or hacked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may already know,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\">cyber security<\/a>&nbsp;is always in the news regardless of industry:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/change-your-passwords-now-collection-1-data-breach\/\">Collection #1 data breach<\/a>&nbsp;that leaked over 1.2 billion unique combinations of email addresses and passwords<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019\/\">Canva and PDL Data breach<\/a> which gives hackers <\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nzherald.co.nz\/business\/news\/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=12026395\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica Scandal<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/business\/companies\/toyota-cyber-attack-leaves-employees-unable-to-access-emails-for-days-20190221-p50z70.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Car manufacturer getting locked out of their email system<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether in the personal or social setting, manufacturing or automative industry, or even healthcare \u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/mounting-security-complexity\/\">these hacks and breaches are only going to increase over time<\/a>. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have systems and processes in place to prevent and reduce the damages in the event of a cyber attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Questions to ask yourself:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In the event of a cyber attack, are you prepared to deal with it?\u00a0<ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-terms\/\">Ransomware<\/a>\u00a0\u2014 where your files get locked up and you can\u2019t access them<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019\/\">Data breach<\/a> \u2014 where sensitive data (yours or your customers) is stolen and leaked to the public\u00a0<\/li><li>DoS \u2014 where you can\u2019t gain access to your systems (e.g. getting locked out of your email server, or your website stops working, etc.)\u00a0<\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>Are your\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff\/\">staff knowledgeable on the most common cyber attacks<\/a>\u00a0and trained to discern them?<\/li><li>Do you have the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things\/\">technology<\/a>\u00a0in place to help you thwart such attacks?<\/li><li>How will you communicate to your customers when their sensitive information gets stolen?\u00a0<\/li><li>How are you going to recover your data when they get deleted or gets encrypted (ransomware)?\u00a0<\/li><li>How long will it take you to resume business after a disaster? Do you have\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1\/\">backups<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly\/\">recovery systems<\/a>\u00a0in place?\u00a0<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Customer-Focused<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the third quality of modern and successful companies is they have the ability to focus on their customers instead of worrying something that isn\u2019t in their core business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB110436476581112426\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Peter Drucker<\/a>, one of the greatest management thinkers of the 21st century, said that \u201cresults are only on the outside.\u201d This was in the context of most leaders tend to focus on internal processes and systems vs what happens on the outside \u2014 customers, partners, the economy, trends, etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successful companies focus on the outside, not on issues within the company like inefficiencies and frustrations brought about by legacy systems.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Questions to ask yourself:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Are there recurring issues that you and your staff face daily? Like printers not working, computers slowing down or not opening at all, internet connectivity problems, etc.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Do certain activities take more than necessary to accomplish certain tasks?&nbsp;<\/li><li>Are internal issues \u2014 IT, accounting, or reporting performance \u2014 keeping you from serving your customers?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern and successful New Zealand businesses all have these three qualities: they\u2019re more productive, low security risks, and customer-focused. They don\u2019t spend their limited resources fighting fires.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, they focus on what really matters. They focus on their customers. They focus on the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To succeed in today\u2019s highly competitive environment, you need to be forward-looking. Instead of doing more of the same, you need to adapt to changes in the market.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help in how you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/futureproof\/\">future proof your business<\/a>, or want to learn more, you can download this white paper. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<script async=\"\" data-uid=\"274cb46742\" src=\"https:\/\/it360-limited.ck.page\/274cb46742\/index.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<a data-formkit-toggle=\"274cb46742\" href=\"https:\/\/it360-limited.ck.page\/274cb46742\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/unfair-advantage-CTA.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\"><\/a>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SMBs often struggle to compete with big brands.
