Here&#8217;s How to Check It&#8217;s Not in Danger"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Data is one of the most valuable assets a business owns &#8211; it is the very essence of what an organisation is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what happens if one day it all just disappeared? It can, and does happen, but the thing is, it doesn\u2019t have to end being a disaster for you and your business if your <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1\/\">data isn&#8217;t backed-up correctly<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Ways to Check if Your Business Data is Backed Up Correctly<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Use the Cloud<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/services\/cloud-solutions\/\">Cloud<\/a> for backing up your data is one of the most cost-effective, efficient ways available. And as mentioned previously, it can expand, and then retract in size, to meet the needs of your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How regularly is it backed up?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your data backed-up on a daily or weekly basis? Is it a full back up, or just incremental, where it only covers the most recently made changes? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are important questions to know the answers to, whether you do it in-house, or have an external resource that looks after the backing-up of your data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more:<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&nbsp;Poor IT will cost a business significantly &#8211; here&#8217;s how to do it the right way<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Check it\u2019s actually working!<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of businesses are confident in the fact that they back-up their data, but it is a very common occurrence that it isn\u2019t done correctly \u2013 which is only discovered after there is a need to access it (usually after a loss). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is best that on a regular basis, you are checking that all your data is actually being backed-up completely and without issues.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. A disaster recovery plan is not enough<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not? Because a disaster recovery plan is only half of the solution when there is a loss of data. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the example of a natural disaster, there is the team who go in and take care of the immediate risks and provide services to those affected \u2013 but after a week or a month, there is the requirement to then get everyone back into \u2018business-as-usual\u2019, where life needs to go back to how it was before the disaster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long does it take for you to get back to &#8220;business-as-usual&#8221; after if a disaster strikes? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your answer is more than a week, then you have a lot of improvements to make. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/it-guide-sme-business\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/An-essential-guide-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Essential Guide to IT for SME Businesses\" class=\"wp-image-6699\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business?
