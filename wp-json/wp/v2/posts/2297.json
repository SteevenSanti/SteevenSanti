But employees are also very much affected by IT issues, and it\u2019s not in the way you\u2019d think. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 Problems of Poor IT Infrastructure<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Lack of control<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When IT issues affect a person\u2019s work, they can often feel like they don\u2019t have any control over their day. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because technology problems get in the way of communication, production, output and task function, when these are interrupted on a regular basis \u2013 there is a loss of power over how efficiently and effectively work can be completed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Stress build-up<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Following on from point 1, if IT issues are a regular occurrence in the workplace, it is very likely that there will be a build-up of frustration, and ultimately stress from not being able to complete duties &#8211; and the flow-on effects arising from delays and disruptions to processes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an employee has to work late or increase their pace significantly when systems are back up and running, there will always be a risk of stress build-up. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Losing traction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When IT issues <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/5-ways-it-issues-are-reducing-your-businesss-productivity\/\">interrupt a workflow<\/a>,  then losing traction is a very real problem. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For jobs which require concentration and focus, problems with the technology being used is extremely detrimental to output, whether due to delays with getting it restarted, or simply being constantly diverted off-task. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Lack of belief in the business<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a business or organisation has constant IT issues that aren\u2019t dealt with correctly, employees may start to feel like their employer doesn\u2019t care about providing them with the right technology to carry out their duties. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this isn\u2019t always the case, but when someone wants to do the work they have been employed to do, it is hard to stay encouraged by an organisation that isn\u2019t able to assist them with their tasks and responsibilities \u2013 you couldn\u2019t be a very good bus driver if you were only given a bike! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/5-ways-it-issues-are-reducing-your-businesss-productivity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">5 ways IT issues are affecting your business&#8217;s productivity<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Loss of motivation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When your employees aren\u2019t able to work efficiently and effectively because of issues outside of your control, it can be hard to maintain a  certain level of motivation to get your work completed. They may think \u201cwhy bother?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it only results in them managing to keep things at an average level of completion.
