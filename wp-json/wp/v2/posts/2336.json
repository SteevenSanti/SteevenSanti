This way it won\u2019t feel as overwhelming either, and you can make sure you don\u2019t blow the budget in the first few months of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Reverse engineer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you know what technology it is that you need, it is a good idea to reverse engineer from the ideal goal, to how you will actually reach it.&nbsp;Otherwise, you could just end up with another piece-meal approach that often occurs from things not being planned out properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a business of 100 staff, and you would like to equip everyone with a new computer, then that might not be achievable right away. You should find out how much the total cost is going to be, work that into your budget over a 12 to 24 month period (or whatever works for your business), and have a solid set out plan of how the implementation of the new technology into your company will occur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calculating ROI is always a good idea for any business too, as you want to know how what you are doing is actually making a difference to your organisation (and for reporting purposes to shareholders\/governance boards).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Softly, softly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is about remaining patient and understanding that technology changes in your business will most likely take a bit of time. Remember, you can\u2019t do everything at once, but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from starting somewhere, and then taking the softly, softly approach to furthering your plans and changes for the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"toc\">\n<strong>Related Reading:<\/strong><br>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/cases\/good-seed-trust-migrate-cloud\/\">How Good Seed Trust Adopted Cloud Technology to Solve their Server Issues<\/a>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 4: Get expert input<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If IT isn\u2019t your area of expertise, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/5-ways-to-get-the-right-it-partner-for-your-business\/\">find someone who knows their stuff<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These types of decisions aren\u2019t ones you should make&nbsp;on your own, without the guidance of someone who can point out all the possible pros and cons to what you want to do. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engage with an IT professional who can&nbsp;provide&nbsp;some valuable opinions on <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/farro-fresh-implements-new-network-solution-partners-with-kordia\/\">implementing new technology<\/a> into your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 5: Follow best practices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Time to bring on the new IT systems in your business? In&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.accesscorp.com\/best-practices-for-implementing-new-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this article here from Archive Systems<\/a>, it says you should follow three best practice guidelines to getting the most out of implementing new technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Set SMART on-boarding goals<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure you get the most out of your technology by identifying&nbsp;SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, results-orientated and time-bound) goals and then pair them with your business metrics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Make it accessible<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone learns differently, meaning different learning styles, at a different pace, and with different needs. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure your training for the new software meets the variation in learning needs&nbsp;and is also accessible when your employees need it .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Blend your training<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For the best results from your on boarding, always blend your training. By providing a combination of in-person and online support for your employees, you will be able to make the most of the time and dollars spent in-person with a&nbsp;trainer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Cyber Security in the Workplace? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/cyber-security-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Guide to Cyber Security in the Workplace eBook\" class=\"wp-image-6708\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a lot of small-to-medium-sized businesses, where IT budgets are&nbsp;typically tight, it is quite common for upgrades and improvements to be made only when there is an emergency \u2013 for example when current systems get overloaded, old software or hardware fails, or there isn\u2019t the right technology available to employees.
