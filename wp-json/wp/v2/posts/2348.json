But what if you could use IT to increase business profitability?  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it was seen as an investment and was able to provide efficiencies that allowed the organisation to focus on growing. Who wouldn\u2019t put their hand up for that? So how could it work? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take these examples; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6 Ways IT Can Increase Business Profitability<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Virtualisation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtualisation is the creation of a virtual form of something in IT \u2013  from a network to storage, hardware or a server. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basically this means you can consolidate and run apps on fewer physical servers,  increasing deployment rates and reducing operational costs. It will also provide you with the flexibility of moving and balancing loads depending on requirements \u00a0&#8211; something\u00a0that is highly recommended if you have unpredictable rates of usage, for example, if you are launching a large project which will put a strain on the current operating system. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Poor IT will cost a business significantly. Here&#8217;s how to do it the right way<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. VoiP and Cloud phone systems<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t yet use VoiP (voice over IP), you\u2019re missing out on a big opportunity to reduce operating costs. Some estimates have said that the implementation of VoiP in business could save them up to 50 percent of their traditional phone bill. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From phone plans, through to messaging and video conferencing, VoiP and Cloud phone systems aid productivity in the workplace by offering a reliable, unified communication system. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Maximising efficiency<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is little doubt that being able to use technology to increase efficiency is one of the best ways for a business to see profitable benefits. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Project management systems are a great example of how individuals and teams can collaborate on tasks together but reduce the time required to have \u2018catch-up\u2019 meetings, and to update others about what they need to be doing \u2013 and of course, this is particularly important for those who don\u2019t work in the same place. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another software you can look at are collaboration tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/services\/microsoft-teams\/\">Microsoft Teams<\/a> that can enable your team to work together efficiently. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Automating tasks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about all the things that occur in your organisation on a daily basis \u2013 are there any processes that are carried out over and over by an individual, or even a team?&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now think about if you were able to implement an automated system around that task. For example \u2013 remember when paying by credit card meant someone had to take a physical impression of it onto carbon paper? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today it\u2019s just a simple scan of a machine and the payment is processed, so more transactions can take place faster. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By maximising output, there\u2019s no doubt \u2013 due to the economies of scale &#8211; that profits are then able to be increased, as it will take less time for a particular task to be carried out. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Provide first-class service to your customers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A customer relationship management (CRM) system is a must for any business. And one that has multiple functionalities will allow you to customise your solutions or products to cater for their needs \u2013 which obviously results in better customer experience, and repeat business (as well as an increase in referrals). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.customermonitor.com\/blog\/how-do-you-calculate-a-net-promoter-score\" target=\"_blank\">Net Promoter Score software<\/a>&nbsp;allows you to capture a wide range of thoughts and feelings from your customers, and take action on those results. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Mobile technology and remote access<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By using technology to make your business <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/modern-workforce\/\">mobile and remotely accessible<\/a>, you are making your products and\/or services available to a  larger market. However, it is important to realise it\u2019s not just about providing people with mobile phones \u2013 as there is a bit more involved than simply being armed with devices. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once the technology is established, it will open up many new opportunities for your business to grow and increase profits. &#8212;&#8212; This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/it-guide-sme-business\/\"><strong>Download:&nbsp;An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/it-guide-sme-business\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/An-essential-guide-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Essential Guide to IT for SME Businesses\" class=\"wp-image-6699\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A lot of organisations still only see IT as an expense \u2013 a cost to the business that adds no particular value, apart from it being a necessity to function (like power\/water etc).
