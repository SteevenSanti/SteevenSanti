If there was an emergency or someone needed to reach him, the receptionist would phone the land lines&nbsp;of each of those five households until she found where he was or where he was heading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through cellphones we can be reached anywhere at any time. While the increase and speed of communication has <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/why-you-must-measure-it-productivity-in-your-business\/\">improved how businesses are run<\/a>, constantly having access to work in your pocket or handbag <strong>blurs the line<\/strong> between work and social life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Work-life Balance: Is there such a thing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have separate personal and work phones? Odds are, you find taking care of two phones more difficult than managing your time with one, and your employees will be exactly the same.&nbsp;That means in addition to your personal email, Facebook, social media and photos you will also have access to work emails, documents, and social media on the same device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A survey by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.arubanetworks.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aruba Networks<\/a>&nbsp;found 6 in 10 people share their work and personal devices with others regularly. That\u2019s phones, laptops and tablets with access to company data, or have business information stored on them.&nbsp;The same survey found 1 in 5 employees don\u2019t have a password on their mobile device, and when asked why not, nearly 1 in 4 said it made it easier to share devices with others. This greatly <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">increases your chances of getting hacked<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time, friends borrowing their devices won\u2019t be malicious. They\u2019ll want to make a call after their own battery has gone flat, check their Facebook or Instagram to satisfy their sense of self\u2010worth, or Google an answer to resolve a dispute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if that friend works at a competing firm? Is your sensitive company information protected from improper use from work devices, or the personal devices of your employees? Over one third of businesses don\u2019t have any type of basic mobile <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies\/\">cyber security monitoring policies<\/a> in place. This makes your business vulnerable, which is backed by the Aruba survey which found 4 in 10 organisations had lost company data through the misuse of a mobile device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise of internet and mobile capabilities has been matched by the growth of cyber\u2010risk. Between 2000 and 2009 over 10% of the world\u2019s computers were infected by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techopedia.com\/definition\/15804\/iloveyou-virus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ILOVEYOU worm<\/a>&nbsp;which caused <strong>over $20 billion worth of damage<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More devices and more people using them increases the security risk to your organisation. A friend borrows your employee\u2019s smartphone and opens the wrong email. All of a sudden that device is infected, with the potential to spread to your company\u2019s server and the phone\u2019s owner has no idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this age of increased communication, capability and sharing, it\u2019s important we match that with the rise of <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things\/\">security measures and protection<\/a>. Our work and social lives might be blurred, but your approach to cyber security doesn\u2019t have to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s best to be upfront with your employees about <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\">cyber security<\/a> to protect your business from unwanted access and nasty viruses.
