And the hard-hitting truth is that all of these IT issues, they are reducing your business\u2019s\u00a0productivity levels, which in turn, translates to a loss of profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">Poor IT will cost a business significantly &#8211; here&#8217;s how to do IT the right way<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 IT Issues Reducing You`r Producitivity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Time-consuming access to data<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are a customer-centric organisation, in FMCG warehousing, or provide essential service maintenance \u2013 having data to work with is imperative. But if there is any delay in accessing it when required, it can cause a series of flow-on effects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also extremely time-consuming is accessing data when a business has multiple programmes that carry out\u00a0different tasks and hold different information. Not having software integrated (especially when it is possible) can result in delays, and a less effective process being carried out \u2013 a place where errors can easily occur.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Unreliable email<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever had a customer or client say \u2018Did you not get my email last week?\u2019 Or you have sent one with important information, only to have it delayed due to issues with your mail provider?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Billions of <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/services\/office-365\/\">business emails<\/a> are sent on a daily basis and you probably don\u2019t care about 99.9% of them. But you do\u00a0want to know you are able to send and receive the ones that are imperative for your business to function, as the\u00a0consequence of them \u2018disappearing into a black hole\u2019 can be extremely detrimental \u2013 what is the cost of missing out\u00a0on a potential customer lead or losing clients due to lack of reliable communication?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Intermittent outages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes our <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/services\/internet-services\/\">business networks, WiFi or access<\/a> to particular programmes can go down for an unknown reason \u2013 too many people in the system you use, an unreliable internet provider, or issues affecting software that need to be fixed by the manufacturer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the case may be, none of these situations is helpful for productivity flow and function \u2013 particularly when they are unexpected, and occur regularly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Slow or old software\/hardware<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a slow computer to work with on a daily basis is extremely frustrating for the individual \u2013 but it actually\u00a0means a lot more to the business as a whole. If software and hardware are <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/microsoft-2008-end-of-support\/\">out of date<\/a>, you could experience\u00a0problems with work functionality and expose your organisation to a greater risk of security threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an employee\u2019s computer takes five minutes to load each day, that is 25 minutes a week wasted. (Not counting if it crashes has to be restarted.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Isolation of IT department\/personnel<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In many organisations, the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/poor-it-will-cost-a-business-significantly\/\">IT department<\/a> is seen as a place you can\u2019t access freely. Raising issues can be time-consuming, and sometimes resolutions are slow to be actioned &#8211; not too mention there is often tension when it\u00a0comes to communication between non-IT individuals and IT personnel (sound familiar?).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the examples mentioned above may seem small, recurrent issues that are unlikely to have a big&nbsp;impact on your the bottom line. But when you look at it more closely \u2013 the lost time and the reduction in business productivity&nbsp;that it causes \u2013 is it really insignificant?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business?
