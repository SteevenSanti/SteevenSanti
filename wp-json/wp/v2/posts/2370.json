Here are two main threats to watch out for.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Top 2 Threats to Using Wi-Fi<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. The Evil Twin<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply, it\u2019s a network that looks just like the regular Wi\u2010Fi network at your favourite caf\u00e9. Only once you\u2019re connected, the hacker who created the network is able to monitor every move you make. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019ll be looking out for sensitive information like login details, bank accounts, and credit card information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:&nbsp;<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/developing-online-security-and-mobile-risk-awareness-in-your-organisation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Developing online security and mobile risk awareness in your business<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. The \u2018War Driver\u2019<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue with common WiFi networks is that anyone can log on. You dont know who you\u2019re sharing a connection with. A hacker can search for devices connected to the same network and intercept data being exchanged across it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business has an open Wi\u2010Fi network, it\u2019s possible for someone to get within range and intercept company emails. They might also be able to connect to your local network and search through your computers for business documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These aren\u2019t theoretical issues. While sitting in a coffee shop in 2014, a couple logged onto the public network and transferred a six\u2010figure sum into a term deposit account. A \u2018war driver\u2019 found their account details, and an email with a signed employment contract attached. Using both, the hacker impersonated them and cleaned out the account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the Banking Ombudsman found the bank\u2019s online security was also lacking, and ordered them to repay the couple, but you may not be so lucky.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have to give up on public Wi\u2010Fi altogether. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">measures you can take to protect yourself and your company data<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Two Tips to Use Wireless Technology Safely<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip #1: Use a VPN<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest solution is a VPN or virtual private network. A VPN can be used on any device to form a secure connection between it and the internet, encrypting all transferred information. If you accidentally connect to an \u2018Evil Twin,\u2019 the encryption prevents the hacker from accessing your data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s important to research VPN providers before signing up. All your data is being transferred through them, so they could steal all your information as easily as any hacker. Trust and reputation is important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tip #2: Use a Wi-Fi Password and Change It Regularly<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Put a password on your office Wi\u2010Fi network and change it regularly. It might be annoying for you and your team, but it\u2019s far less annoying than all of your sensitive files ending up in public. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth looking at a firewall to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic through your network. A firewall will let you know if someone is trying to force their way in, and if you need to boost security even further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are risks with any online activity, but a VPN and firewall can help protect you and your business while browsing in public.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Cyber Security in the Workplace? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-workplace\/\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/cyber-security-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Guide to Cyber Security in the Workplace eBook\" class=\"wp-image-6708\" title=\"\"><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chances are you have already used Wi\u2010Fi today.
