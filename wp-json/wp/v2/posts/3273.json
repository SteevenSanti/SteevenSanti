The scary part is that most of them don\u2019t even know they\u2019ve been attacked, or worse, breached \u2014 meaning, someone was able to access confidential and sensitive information of your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you\u2019re probably asking\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/More-than-70-percent-of-SMEs-targeted-by-cyber-attack.png\" alt=\"More than 70 percent of SMEs targeted by cyber attack\" class=\"wp-image-3291\" title=\"\"><figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Happens When You Get Hacked<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s not really a straight-forward answer to this question, because there are <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/what-happens-when-you-get-hacked\/\">different types of hacking<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, it can be as simple as someone posting a tweet using your business account saying \u201cI got hacked by (blank).\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or it can be very serious like adding passwords to all your files which leads to you not being able to access them (since you don\u2019t know the password). You will then have to get in touch with the hacker to pay them a huge amount of money. Then they will send the <em>password<\/em> that will allow you to regain access to all your files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an example of <strong>ransomware<\/strong>. It\u2019s one of the most common types of cyber attack, which we\u2019ll cover below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another type of hacking that has bigger repercussions is when personal information is leaked. This includes social media information, address, and job info like what happened in the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/canva-and-pdl-data-breach-2019\/\">PDL data breach<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when personal data is leaked, we&#8217;re now talking about your physical security. When hackers gain access to your internet banking credentials, it&#8217;s only your money that is at risk. You can always earn it back. But when your physical safety is at risk, lives are at stake. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the effects of these actions on your business:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Problem 1<\/strong>: Without the ability to access your data, your organization stops working.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you and your employees can\u2019t connect to the internet or access your data, your organization stops working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Problem 2<\/strong>: If organizational data gets breached\/stolen, it can cost a huge amount of money and create animosity in the eyes of your customers.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s only the first quarter in 2019, these types of news won\u2019t stop soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Costs of Cyber Attacks You\u2019re Probably Not Aware Of<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When your business is involved in a data breach, two things happen:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>You lose revenues<\/li><li>You spend more<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The first downside of getting breached is you <strong>lose the trust of your customers<\/strong> (and would-be customers). This leads to lost revenues for your business. Apart from that, you\u2019d have to <strong>spend more<\/strong> to recover what was lost in terms of salaries and fees, not to mention the penalties you may pay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With lost revenues and added costs, that puts a big dent on your company\u2019s profitability. And if you\u2019re a small company without deep pockets, a cyber attack might put you out of business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/10\/13\/cyberattacks-cost-small-companies-200k-putting-many-out-of-business.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report<\/a>, over 60% of SMBs close shop within 6 months after a data breach and is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hiscox.com\/documents\/2019-Hiscox-Cyber-Readiness-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">costing businesses $200,000 on average<\/a>\u2014which includes lost business, regulatory fines, and remediation costs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind\/\">Don\u2019t wait until your business gets hacked<\/a>!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"toc\">The question you should be asking now is, \u201c<strong>are you prepared for a cyber attack?<\/strong>\u201d If your answer is not a definite yes, then you can benefit from our <a aria-label=\"undefined (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-assessment\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">free cyber security assessment<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"crucial-areas\">7 Crucial Areas of Cyber Security You Need to Consider in Your Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensuring cyber security requires the coordination of efforts throughout an information system, which includes the following categories:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Network security<\/strong> is the process of securing a computer network from intruders, from both <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/15-cybersecurity-myths-business-owners-should-leave-behind\/\">direct and indirect attacks<\/a>.<\/li><li><strong>Application security<\/strong> focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/this-data-stealing-android-malware-infiltrated-the-google-play-store-infecting-users-in-196-countries\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compromised application<\/a> could provide access to the data of its users (and your business.<\/li><li><strong>Information security<\/strong> protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit. This includes <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/backing-up-company-data-simple-as-3-2-1\/\">protecting your backups<\/a> as well.<\/li><li><strong>Operational security<\/strong> includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.<\/li><li><strong>Disaster recovery and business continuity<\/strong> dictate how your business gets back on its feet and restore operations should a disaster or a cyber security breach that caused data loss occur.<\/li><li><strong>End-user education<\/strong> addresses the most unpredictable cyber security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Phishing attacks are the most common threat your staff should be knowledgeable about.<\/li><li><strong>Leadership commitment<\/strong> is the key to the successful implementation of any cyber security project. Without it, it is very difficult to establish, implement and maintain effective processes.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most problematic elements of cybersecurity is the <strong>constantly evolving nature<\/strong> of security risks. This is also the main reason why there\u2019s a shortage of talent in the industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the main reason why you should have a <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/free-consult-booking\/\">reliable IT partner<\/a> to stay on top of all these changes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/people-pointing-to-laptop-screen-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"important areas in cyber security no one is talking about\" width=\"512\" height=\"342\" title=\"\"><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Two Additional Areas of Cyber Security No One Is Talking About<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Mobile security<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern businesses are powered by a mobile workforce. As a business owner, you\u2019re always on the go. You\u2019re with your phone 24\/7, talking to your customers, chatting with your team, accessing files and emails, and much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital that you keep your phone (and your employee\u2019s devices) protected \u2014 both physically and digitally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by adding a password\/passcode to your devices. For ease of use, there are people who still don\u2019t use them. Also, consider using a VPN, especially when using your device to connect to public Wi-Fis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been cases where personal devices were the cause of security breaches. Even without any malicious intent, an employee may plug in a personal USB to bring in some documents to finish over the weekend can become the reason why your business gets hacked. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Internet-of-things (IoT) security<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology is continuously making our lives easier and simpler. And it definitely is <em>invading <\/em>our homes and offices \u2014 from as simple as an automatic garage door opener, to the temperature control in your living room, to speakers that can play music and even make orders online; or smart printers where you just send an email to a specific address and it prints out automatically, or programmable coffee machines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these are conveniences brought about by technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, they are not without risks. Unlike our computers, IoT devices do not have anti-virus software as their first line of defense.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these devices don\u2019t have updated security protocols, a hacker can easily get in and gain access to all your devices. They can see you in your own CCTV, hear you in your speakers, and everything else you see in movies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep yourself protected. The best way to do this is to <strong>update your software\/firmware<\/strong> and <strong>add passwords<\/strong> to your devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more tips on how to protect yourself, read this article on <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">how to avoid getting hacked<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"pillars\">3 Pillars of Cyber Security You Need to Focus On<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re keen on understanding and implementing cyber security for your business, there are three areas (or pillars) you need to look into: people, processes and technology.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This three-pronged approach helps organisations defend themselves from both organised attacks and common internal threats, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">accidental breaches and human error<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things\/\">Technology<\/a><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/protect-yourself-online-by-focusing-on-these-two-things\/\"> encompasses both software and hardware<\/a>. The most common one you are probably using is antivirus software. But, as you may probably know, none of these is perfect. Some <em>will<\/em> get through the cracks. That&#8217;s why the other two pillars are important. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Processes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Processes are your <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/no-cyber-security-policy\/\">policies<\/a> and how you company deals with online security and protection. This includes:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How you <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/is-your-business-data-backed-up-correctly\/\">protect and backup your data<\/a>, <\/li><li>BYOD policies (Bring Your Own Device), <\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/5-steps-to-help-you-recover-from-targeted-cyber-attack\/\">What you do in the event of a breach<\/a>, and <\/li><li>How you <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/5-ways-to-communicate-cyber-security-with-staff\/\">communicate cyber security to your staff<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. People<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to one study, people have a contribution to <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">96% of all breaches<\/a>. Without any <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyberwise-free-trial\/\">continuous education on best practices<\/a>, your organisation could be next. Learn the most <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/organisation-phishing-targets\/\">common targets in your organisation<\/a> and how you can avoid them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you\u2019re looking at something you can do today to protect yourself, you can <strong>enroll in our 4-day email course on passwords<\/strong> below. In this series, you\u2019ll learn exactly how \u201csecure\u201d your password is and what you should do to keep them safe.<\/p>\n\n\n<script async data-uid=\"ae70475494\" src=\"https:\/\/it360-limited.ck.page\/ae70475494\/index.js\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"common-threats\">Most Common Cyber Security Threats to Your Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Malware<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Malware, short for <em>mal<\/em>icious soft<em>ware<\/em>, is any software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer. It\u2019s the <em>general<\/em> term for viruses, trojans, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Ransomware<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ransomware is a type of malware designed to extort money by blocking access to files\/computers until <em>ransom<\/em> is paid. This is the example we wrote above. In a recent attack, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.darkreading.com\/attacks-breaches\/6-things-to-know-about-the-ransomware-that-hit-norsk-hydro\/d\/d-id\/1334270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ransomware caused this company over $40m already<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Social Engineering<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Social engineering is a tactic that aims to convince a user to disclose sensitive information such as passwords and credit card numbers by impersonating other people. The most common social engineering example involves someone posing as the CEO and sends an email to the accounting\/finance department to transfer money to a \u201csupplier.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Phishing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent emails (or any other communication platform like SMS or calls) that resemble messages coming from reputable sources with the intention of stealing sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/woman-having-coffee-while-reading-on-laptop-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"learn cyber security while on your break\" width=\"512\" height=\"342\" title=\"\"><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"terms\">7 Most Common Cyber Security Terms You Need to Know<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the most common threats you may face in your business, there are other <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-terms\/\">cyber security terms<\/a> you need to be familiar with. These terms are often in news sites. A better understanding will greatly help you reduce the risks to you and your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Vulnerability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A vulnerability is a weakness in design, implementation, operation or internal control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Remember the 3 pillars of cyber security above? If one of them, say your technology, isn\u2019t updated, a hacker can easily get in your systems. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Denial-of-service (DoS)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DoS attacks are designed to make a computer or network resource unavailable to its intended users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/business\/companies\/toyota-cyber-attack-leaves-employees-unable-to-access-emails-for-days-20190221-p50z70.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>what happened to Toyota<\/em><\/a><em> last February where the staff can\u2019t access their emails for days. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Spoofing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spoofing is the act of masquerading as a valid entity through falsification of data in order to gain access to information or resources that one is otherwise unauthorized to obtain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This is similar to phishing in the sense that hackers try to deceive the person receiving it, but the main difference is that spoofing is for delivery whereas phishing is for retrieval. You won\u2019t knowingly download a malware, right? But if someone tricked you into clicking a link, say about your business getting sued, you will most likely click on it. That will then lead to a download of some sort of malware. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Adware<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Adware is a form of malware, malicious or not, that hides on your device and displays advertisements on a computer. Some adware also monitors your behavior online so it can target you with specific ads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A common sign that you have adware is when your browser\u2019s homepage changes into something else, i.e. when you open it, a website automatically loads instead of your default page. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Spyware<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spyware is a form of malware that hides on your device, monitors your activity, and steals sensitive information like bank details and passwords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>One example of spyware is a keystroke logger, or keylogger (see below).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Keylogger<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyloggers secretly records what you <em>type<\/em> on your computers and devices. Employers use keyloggers to watch employees, but cybercriminals use them too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>On its own, you can track productivity levels and what people do, but when used maliciously, you can steal credit card information and other sensitive data. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Trojan<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Trojans are software programs that claims to do A, but does B instead. They can take the form of attachments, downloads, and fake videos\/programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Taking its name from the Greek Mythology, the trojan horse allows a hacker to get into your system by promising to do one thing (offering to Athena), but also allowing the hacker to do other things (get inside Troy).<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Cyber-Security-Tips-to-Protect-Your-Business.png\" alt=\"Cyber Security Tips to Protect Your Business\" class=\"wp-image-3290\" title=\"\"><figcaption>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"tips\">Top Cyber Security Tips to Protect Your Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to protect your business from cyber attacks.
