It then locks up their files and they have to get a key to unlock it, and the hackers charge a ransom for the key,\u201d Bailey said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If an employee touches a computer, they need training.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Train employees about how to handle emails, embedded URLs in emails, and phishing scams, whether by email or phone.

Back up your data.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEveryone should back their data up off site on a regular basis.

Don\u2019t&nbsp;pay ransoms.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe never recommend paying the ransom. You don\u2019t know if you will get the key&nbsp;and the hacker may see you as a good source of cash and target you again. And&nbsp;some of them don\u2019t write very good code so even if you get the key, it is likely&nbsp;it won\u2019t work.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Guard your personal information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Hackers are after data they can sell online.<\/strong>&nbsp;Computer records that include dates of birth, addresses, and things like that, these guys grab that stuff&nbsp;and&nbsp;resell it on the Dark Web.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardise a corporate protocol for passwords.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set a minimum number of characters. Establish what mix of upper case and lower case, numbers and special characters you want. Consider implementing two-factor authentication. Create processes that force employees to update their passwords on a regular schedule. Do not permit recycling of a previous password.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about how you can protect your passwords, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-series-passwords\/\">enroll in our free email series on passwords<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Security is difficult and highly complex.
