The basic premise of this rule is to save three copies of your data \u2013 two on different media (for example, two different external hard drives), and one off-site (for example, in your company warehouse).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you have three copies of your data, then the risk of losing them all is very small. Although it may seem slightly cumbersome and over-the-top, it will give you peace of mind that no matter what happens, you won\u2019t lose years of hard work.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The concept was created by Peter Krogh, an American photographer. In an article for dpbestflow.org Mr Krogh\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dpbestflow.org\/node\/262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">wrote<\/span><\/a> that there are two types of people in the world: \u201cthose who have had hard drive failure, and those who will.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In other words, hard drive failure is inevitable, so you might as well protect yourself as best you can.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Mr Krogh also wrote extensively about some of the circumstances that could lead to data loss, such as security threats, device failure, malicious damage, viruses, device glitches, and even lightning strikes\/voltage surges.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, he provides guidance on how to manage backups \u2013 for example, what to keep and what to let go. We\u2019ve summarised some of his key points below.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4 Key Points in Managing Your Backups<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">1. Identify your primary copy<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">You might have copies of the same file saved in several places. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Identify the primary copy \u2013 this is what you will backup.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">2. Physically separate your backups<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">A key component of the 3-2-1 rule is to make sure <strong>at least one of your backups is stored offsite<\/strong>, so your files will be protected in the event of a natural disaster.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">3. Implement rolling backups<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">Create a system that offers automatic backups, so you never go an extended period of time between backups (the longer you go, the more data that\u2019s exposed).&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><span class=\"s1\">4. Conduct a trial restoration<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span class=\"s1\">You won\u2019t know that a backup works until it comes time to test it. Try to <strong>test your backup systems before disaster strikes<\/strong>, so you know for sure that they work.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">The 3-2-1 rule is so well-respected that it\u2019s employed by the US government \u2013 or at least, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.backblaze.com\/blog\/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"s2\">this article<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cThere is no such thing as a perfect backup system, but the 3-2-1 approach is a great start for the majority of people and businesses,\u201d the article reads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">\u201cEven the United States Government recommends this approach. In a 2012 paper for US-CERT (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team), Carnegie Mellon recommended the 3-2-1 method in their publication titled: Data Backup Options.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">We can learn a lot from the 3-2-1 rule and Mr Krogh. It takes a comprehensive and logical approach to data loss and security and puts much of the power back in our own hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p2\">With technology evolving at such a rapid pace, it can be tempting to tend towards apathy or overwhelm. Instead, the 3-2-1 rule is methodical and rational \u2013 something we should all aspire towards in our own cyber security strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen to understand more about Online Security Protection for New Zealand businesses? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/go\/online-security-for-nz-businesses\/ebook\/\">Download our latest eBook &#8211; it&#8217;s FREE<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 3-2-1 rule is a widely used technique for backing up information.
