It&#8217;s vital to step up your security and take precaution to mitigate these risks, no matter how small or large your business is.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8221; Without digital technologies, we wouldn&#8217;t exist. Literally, every part of the business we have, including alarms and notifications, is all about having a strong underlying safe network, &#8220;<\/em>  says Simon Folley, Data &amp; IT Manager of&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.farro.co.nz\/\" target=\"_blank\">Farro&nbsp;Fresh<\/a>,  <em>&#8221; &#8230; instead of spending the day worrying what could happen, we could actually plan for the future of the business. &#8220;<\/em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too often, <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\">cyber security<\/a> remains an afterthought, and this can become a nightmare during major holidays and end-of-year sales, a peak shopping time for retailers where attacks mostly happen. According to a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cert.govt.nz\/assets\/Uploads\/Quarterly-report\/2019-Q3\/cert-nz-highlights-report-q3-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a> by the National Computer Emergency Response (CERT), <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">cyber security<\/g> attacks cost over $12 million (in total financial loss) the first three quarters of 2019 &#8211; and that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. The report also mentioned that Q3 had a 13% increase in incidents compared to the previous quarter. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> While security measures built have delayed the number of cases, it makes sense to stay vigilant in watching out for vulnerabilities in your system these days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-wordpress aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-wistia-inc\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"iT360 - Farro Cyber Security Case Study Video\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.net\/embed\/iframe\/9kktqkmu89?dnt=1#?secret=fzbUzqhttj\" data-secret=\"fzbUzqhttj\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:24px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cyber Security: Understanding the Risks Involved and How to Deal<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From small enterprises to the Fortune 100, retail is focusing more on compliance and payment protection that opened the door for cyber attackers to shift their tactics to stealing personal information so they can carry out online fraud or even loyalty program hacks. As a result, this&nbsp;stolen data&nbsp;is&nbsp;being sold on the Dark Web to compromise existing security systems, and even go as far as converting loyalty points into cash or store credit. Here are some things you need to know right now:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. The Internet of Things (IoT) is Here to Stay <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advent of smart devices come headaches on how to deal with security nightmares. Consumers these days are turning to their devices to make purchases for them and this trend will grow by 2021 (and beyond).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retailers need to be aware of <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/dont-want-to-get-hacked-follow-these-21-cyber-security-tips\/\">unpatched security vulnerabilities and weaknesses<\/a> that can bring about their network&#8217;s demise. Using devices with built-in security features and stronger passwords, plus regular security patch updates, will come in handy.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of&nbsp;Farro&nbsp;Fresh, they called in for trusted network solutions provider who can help.  <em>&#8221; iT360 are a long term&nbsp;Watchguard&nbsp;partner; been a gold partner for a number of years.

E-Commerce Poses a Significant Risk for Retail <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most online stores are focused on delivering an intuitive, user-friendly experience and in doing so, may compromise data security. Not all systems are 100% resistant to cyber<g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del gr-progress sel\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\"> <\/g>attacks and one needs to constantly monitor and review new features being rolled out. If your business doesn&#8217;t have the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/mounting-security-complexity\/\">capacity to protect customers&#8217; personal and financial information<\/a>, they will choose another option. Simple. If you&#8217;re accepting cryptocurrency, double the jeopardy then as crypto mining malware on servers <g class=\"gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"10\" data-gr-id=\"10\">are<\/g> a reality. As early as now, get your IT checking out for any exploits that may happen in your system before it&#8217;s too late. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. The Double-Edged Sword We Call&#8230; &#8216;The Cloud&#8217; <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what your industry is, there&#8217;s always a risk when your most valuable data is stored in the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/7-advantages-of-cloud-computing\/\">cloud<\/a>. On the other hand, it gives you an opportunity to do business-on-the-go, anywhere and on any device. From automatic payments, smart kiosks, to retail mobile apps &#8211; making sure that people are doing so in a secured network is just the first step. Then, there are vast quantities of data you need to protect and having an AI-driven cyber security measure is imperative if you want to protect platforms, as well as your customers, from cyber threats. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a study by Microsoft New Zealand, a cyberattack can cost a large retail&nbsp;organisation&nbsp;an average of $27.7 million (US$18.7 million) &#8211; directly or indirectly, in terms of economic loss.

Think of the job losses happening because of these, or customers shopping elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Good News: Don&#8217;t Let Fear Stall Your Digital Transformation Initiative <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Head on to the meeting room with your&nbsp;organisation&#8217;s&nbsp;management and IT teams!
