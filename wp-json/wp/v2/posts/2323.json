It is not uncommon for every business to encounter something unforeseen when it comes to their technology, no matter how prepared they are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can, and does happen, and has a tendency to cause stress within management when there needs to be an over-budget spend. So minimise this issue by always having a safety net of allocation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"innovation\">Maintenance vs innovation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>IT spend is no longer just about <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/building-a-resilient-technology-infrastructure\/\">maintaining technology<\/a> in your business \u2013 the most successful companies these days are the ones who leverage IT to be innovative and forward-thinking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to setting your budget, plan for continuing with regular maintenance to ensure daily tasks are able to be carried out. But also allocate spend for <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/4-emerging-security-monitoring-technologies\/\">technology that can assist you with growing your business<\/a> \u2013 because this is one of the best investments you can make. It\u2019s certainly not something you want to miss out on just because you didn\u2019t \u2018budget for it\u2019. And if you go one step further, by working out the expected ROI on the investment, you\u2019ll no doubt see why innovation is an essential part of your IT spend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/how-to-use-it-to-increase-business-profitability\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How to: Use IT to increase business profitability<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"business\">Aligning business strategy and IT spend<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Business strategies and the IT budget should always go hand-in-hand. These days, where almost every business function has an element of technology intrinsically linked to it, there is no setting of one aspect without the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business plans to expand by 50 per cent over the next three years \u2013 what affect will this have on IT? What new software or hardware will be required to support the growth, and what implications will that have on the budget?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can plan these aspects before they arise, then there is less of an issue when it comes to actioning those items, and having to spend more than what was allocated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"other_departments\">Ensure every department is covered<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to setting an IT budget, you need to make sure all departments of the business are able to provide input into where they may require spend. The marketing department may need a new CRM system to roll out their next stage of development, or finance may be looking to purchase new software system for the accounts \u2013 and of course, these require a portion of the IT budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than thinking about IT as its own separate entity, consider how it impacts on the plans of all other functions of the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"outsourcing\"><strong>Could outsourcing be budget-friendly?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best things you can do for your IT budget is work out if outsourcing a part of it (or even all of it) is going result in cost-effectiveness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no point in assuming outsourcing will cost more unless you have actually done your research with a range of providers to understand what is available \u2013 you might be quite surprised!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/it-guide-sme-business\/\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/An-essential-guide-CTA-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Download the Essential Guide to IT for SME Businesses\" class=\"wp-image-6699\" title=\"\"><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business?
