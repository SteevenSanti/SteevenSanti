It does,\nthough, contain profiles of hundreds of millions of people that include home\nand cell phone numbers, associated social media profiles like Facebook,\nTwitter, LinkedIn, and Github, work histories seemingly scraped from LinkedIn,\nalmost 50 million unique phone numbers, and 622 million unique email addresses.\n&#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/billion-records-exposed-online\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wired<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more and more breaches and cyber security incidents happen, the more we all have to learn how we can protect ourselves online. Below are three things you should do immediately after learning that your data as part of a breach. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Things You Need to Do Immediately After a Data Breach<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Change your passwords<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment you learn of a data\nbreach, especially if you are part of the breach, it\u2019s the perfect time to\nchange your password. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To those asking, a data breach\nor leak doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your account was accessed. It\u2019s possible, yes.\nBut unless you can speak with the hacker, you can\u2019t be 100% sure. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leaves you with the next\nbest course of action \u2014 change your password. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure you won\u2019t risk\ngetting hacked again, we\u2019ve created a <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/cyber-security-series-passwords\/\">4-day email course on creating and using stronger passwords<\/a>.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Don\u2019t reuse passwords<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>91% understand the risk of reusing\npasswords, but 55% do it anyway. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please, if you want to remain\nsafe online, stop reusing passwords. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it\u2019s very difficult to\nremember unique passwords for all our accounts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick question: when was the\nlast time you counted how many accounts and profiles you have? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me? I have <strong>348 accounts<\/strong>\naccounted for. Possibly even more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you have over 300+\naccounts, which you most likely do, can you remember strong, unique passwords\nfor every one of them? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe, but it\u2019s no easy feat. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only way to <em>remember<\/em>\nall your passwords without having to remember them is to use a password\nmanager. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s also the reason how I\nknew I have 348 accounts. It\u2019s the easiest way to manage all my accounts \u2014 from\nemail addresses, various social media accounts, WiFi passwords, tools like\nCanva, and many more. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn how you can <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/anti-password-nirvana\/\">use\npassword managers and stop reusing passwords<\/a> by watching this free\nvideo.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Understand the repercussions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dataviper.io\/blog\/2019\/pdl-data-exposure-billion-people\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vinny Troia<\/a>, a dark web researcher, said &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve seen all these social media profiles collected and merged with user profile information into a single database on this scale. From the perspective of an attacker, if the goal is to impersonate people or hijack their accounts, you have names, phone numbers, and associated account URLs. That&#8217;s a lot of information in one place to get you started.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about that for a second. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What information have you posed\non your social media accounts? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Birthdays<\/li><li>Pets<\/li><li>Family\nmembers and who\u2019s related to whom<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aren\u2019t these the same\ninformation we use as passwords or security questions? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all that information is in\none place, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for someone to reset your passwords and\ngain access to your accounts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is unless you enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without MFA, anyone with these data can try resetting the passwords to your accounts easily. Watch this video to learn the importance of MFA. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/kxlgfmbu2t.jsonp\" async=\"\"><\/script><script src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/assets\/external\/E-v1.js\" async=\"\"><\/script><div class=\"wistia_responsive_padding\" style=\"padding:100.0% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><div class=\"wistia_responsive_wrapper\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;\"><div class=\"wistia_embed wistia_async_kxlgfmbu2t videoFoam=true\" style=\"height:100%;position:relative;width:100%\"><div class=\"wistia_swatch\" style=\"height:100%;left:0;opacity:0;overflow:hidden;position:absolute;top:0;transition:opacity 200ms;width:100%;\"><img src=\"https:\/\/fast.wistia.com\/embed\/medias\/kxlgfmbu2t\/swatch\" style=\"filter:blur(5px);height:100%;object-fit:contain;width:100%;\" alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" onload=\"this.parentNode.style.opacity=1;\" title=\"\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Over to You<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\">Cyber security<\/a> is a topic you should take seriously,\nespecially when it comes to your business.
