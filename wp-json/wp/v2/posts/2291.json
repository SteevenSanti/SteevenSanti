How Large Was The Attack<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019re aware a cyber attack has taken place it\u2019s important to <strong>figure out the size of the attack<\/strong>. This will enable you to correctly assess the right amount of resources needed in fixing your problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A network analysis can help you find out which systems have been affected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. How Did The Attack Occur<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By determining the cause you can prevent similar intrusions in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could your network have caused the issue? Was it an email virus? Did someone download a free programme from a  less\u2010than\u2010trustworthy website?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some warning signs to look out for include computers frequently crashing, visits from strange IP addresses or large data transfers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

Hackers then contact the business owners <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/ransomware-attacks-are-real-is-your-business-safe\/\">asking for a ransom<\/a> before sending through the encryption key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses of all sizes were hit, and many are figuring out how to cope after losing all their data.
