Understand its purpose<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, some businesses may prefer to have the policy of \u2018common sense\u2019 in place, but if an issue arises because of usage that, in hindsight, wasn\u2019t appropriate, what ramifications will be in place?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you have set up <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/how-to-set-up-risk-management\/\">IT risk management<\/a> for your organisation, then an IT policy is a natural component of mitigating potential threats to your business\u2019s data and information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to cover these six key elements:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Acceptable use of technology<\/strong> \u2013 guidelines around use<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/cyber-security-101-guide-to-protecting-your-business-online\/\"><strong>Cyber Security<\/strong><\/a> \u2013 guidelines around how to ensure personal and business data\/information is always secure<\/li><li><strong>Disaster recovery<\/strong> \u2013 procedures on how this will role out in the event of a disaster<\/li><li><strong>Technology standards<\/strong> \u2013 what software\/hardware can and can\u2019t be used<\/li><li><strong>Network set up and documentation<\/strong> \u2013 guidelines around <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/iot-network-and-endpoint-security-challenges\/\">how employees are to use the network<\/a> and what level of access they are provided with<\/li><li><strong>IT services<\/strong> \u2013 information surrounding the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/services\/managed-it-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">service management of IT\u00a0<\/a>(ideally linked to already established framework)<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Set clear guidelines for users<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t want to confuse your employees with too many rules around what they can and can\u2019t do when it comes to using technology in the work environment, particularly when IT is so ingrained in our day-to-day lives now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So be clear and concise about expectations \u2013 there\u2019s no point in creating a headache for everyone involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that a report released by Deloitte and Google, showed that being more flexible with your IT policy can actually provide big rewards for businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an increase in employment relations issues around the use of Internet and email, the Government\u2019s employment website&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/eab.business.govt.nz\/employmentagreementbuilder\/startscreen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has this example<\/a>&nbsp;of what an Internet and email policy could look like (scroll down to 11.4).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Be open and honest<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to putting together an IT policy, it\u2019s best to be open and honest about why you have certain guidelines in place. You certainly don\u2019t want to create an atmosphere of \u2018big brother is always watching\u2019 as it doesn\u2019t tend to foster a positive environment for employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you provide a particular guideline to reduce risk for your business \u2013 <strong>explain why it is in place<\/strong>, as you\u2019ll find there will be a greater level of compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog post is a condensed version of an article in our latest eBook.&nbsp;Keen on further knowledge on how to manage IT in your business? <a href=\"https:\/\/info.it360.co.nz\/lp\/it-guide-sme-business\/\"><strong>Download:&nbsp;An essential guide to IT for SME business &#8211; Risk, Security and Productivity<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a document that helps to monitor and review IT processes, it also provides guidelines for users.
