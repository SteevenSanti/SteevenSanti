However the thought of a threat to our businesses coming via a computer, over the internet, is still seen by many as a futuristic issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In-fact, those businesses taking out cyber security insurance is on the up, and there are plenty of organisations who are already making the move to cover themselves should the unexpected (and undesirable) occur. So the question is, should your business have it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would certainly be proactive for any business leader responsible for IT to look into the possibility of cyber security&nbsp;insurance. Like anything, it\u2019s best that you gather as much knowledge as possible around the subject before embarking on a decision-making process. And when it comes to insurance, no policy is the same, so it is imperative to understand what will actually be covered should you take out insurance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to Look for in a Cyber Security Insurance<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to this breakdown from Crombie Lockwood, cyber security insurance typically provides resources or cover for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Defence costs and damages<\/strong> relating to third party claims for breaches of privacy etc<\/li><li>The <strong>reconstruction of data and the loss of income<\/strong> following a cyber attack on your network<\/li><li>Costs and expenses for advice and support in repairing <strong>reputational damage and loss of customer confidence<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to know what exclusions limitations apply to the policy, and this could range anywhere from&nbsp;un-encrypted data to cloud and mobile data, first party notification and data restoration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before getting bogged down in the technical side of things, it is best to do a risk assessment of your business&nbsp;to work out what kind of cover or protection you actually need. For example, if you don\u2019t collect customer\u2019s credit card details, then you may not need to have credit monitoring services in your policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2014, the Insurance Council of New Zealand joined forces with the Government on a cyber security initiative, and what came from this was Connect Smart.
