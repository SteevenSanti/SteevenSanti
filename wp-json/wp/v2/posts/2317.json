Your e-business infrastructure, or information technology infrastructure, is a&nbsp;set of information&nbsp;technology&nbsp;(IT) components that are the foundation of an IT service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s composed of both physical components (such as computer and networking hardware, data centers, and other facilities) and also various software applications and network components (like cloud computing technology).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the size, industry, and business model, the technology infrastructure of businesses is unique to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because business owners and leaders rely on IT to manage their organisation, it&#8217;s imperative that the entire IT infrastructure can handle both planned and unplanned disruptions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan for the Unexpected<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Any disruption to a business\u2019 workflow, whether it\u2019s positive or negative can result in a lack of productivity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\u2019s fast\u00ad-paced marketplace this can be more than a hiccup, rather the final heart attack that flatlines a business. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiccups can lead to any or all of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Loss of reputation <\/li><li>Loss of clientele<\/li><li>Decreasing the value of a business<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to avoid this domino effect, resilient infrastructure aims to limit the potential financial strain a business needs to acknowledge before responding and resolving the issue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all business risks can be resolved, but some can be alleviated and managed. It is important to know a business\u2019 systems capacity, so in the event of a crisis identifying and fixing the issue becomes easier. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to do this is to audit and evaluate business processes to see whether there are risks in the IT systems that support that function. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Christchurch author was interviewed on TV3s Campbell Live, driving many viewers to the author\u2019s website. The increased traffic crashed the website, halting online book orders and harming their business. The issue was fixed easily but could have been avoided if they had anticipated the web visitor increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan for Everyday Scenarios<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your CRM and SCM systems are in place, that\u2019s not the time to relax. You should always be looking for ways to streamline your operation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also a good idea to train multiple people to manage key roles, in case an employee leaves or isn\u2019t there when a crisis hits. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more people who know what to do in the event something goes wrong, the more resilient your business\u2019 infrastructure will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the <a href=\"https:\/\/it360.co.nz\/blog\/farro-fresh-implements-new-network-solution-partners-with-kordia\/\">network crashes<\/a> and your tills go offline, or there\u2019s a massive increase in demand and the line starts growing out the door?
